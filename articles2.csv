1,Tribune News Report,1/26/2018 0:00,"Department of Labor and Industry Deputy Secretary for Workforce Development Eileen Cipriani continued the Wolf administration's 'Jobs that Pay' tour today at the Gettysburg Campus of HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College, and announced a new industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeship.

""Employers across Pennsylvania need trained and skilled workers and apprenticeships give young people and experienced workers the chance to earn while they learn,"" said Gov. Tom Wolf.

""Creating new apprenticeship programs not only helps meet the needs of regional employers, but provides job seekers with training that leads to family-sustaining jobs.""

After the tour concluded, Cipriani announced the department's Apprenticeship and Training Office approved a second cohort of HACC's Industrial Manufacturing Technician Apprenticeship Program.

The apprentices learn quality, production and maintenance skills.

""Apprenticeship programs like this are a great example of state agencies, education and local businesses collaborating to help meet regional employment needs,"" said Cipriani said.

""These types of partnerships are a win-win for employees as well because they help direct valuable training dollars to the industries and sectors that are actively seeking skilled workers.""

Representatives from SCPa Works and Hanes Pure Protein joined on the tour of classrooms and a mechatronics lab.

""This Industrial Manufacturing Technician Apprenticeship Program at HACC was developed in conjunction with industry experts to help companies fill the skills gap that exists. This program will allow a dedicated pipeline of 'ready-to-work' individuals to fill vacancies in much-needed jobs in Central Pennsylvania's manufacturing industries,"" said Lauren Holubec, director of manufacturing and logistics in HACC's Workforce Development and Continuing Education Division.

The Wolf administration established the Apprenticeship and Training Office in 2016 to support and expand apprenticeships.

Programs registered through the office provide employer-driven training to create a more productive, diverse, highly skilled workforce for employers and to help reduce employee turnover.

Job-seekers receive increased skills and a nationally recognized credential to support future career advancement and increased wages.

""We are excited about this program and thank Hain Pure Protein for their excitement and involvement in the creation of this second IMT cohort,"" Holubec said.

""The six students in the cohort will be made up of employees from Hain Pure Protein at the company's New Oxford location and will attend classes and training at HACC's Gettysburg Campus."""
5,Staff,1/26/18 11:26 AM,"SANDPOINT In 1937, during the era of the Great Depression, employers were in need of workers with specific qualifications.

For that reason,apprenticeships were implemented into the workforce.

Eighty years later, apprenticeship programs still exist and are still a benefit to many employers who are looking for a specific skill set.

""There are more than 1,000 different occupations that areapprenticeable occupations through the U.S. Department of Labor, and every day it continues to grow,"" said John Russ, regional manager for the Idaho Department of Labor in the Meridian area.

Russ was in Sandpoint, along with Ricia Lasso, IDL North Idaho regional business specialist, to talk about ApprenticeshipIdaho, aRegistered Apprenticeship programadministered through the Idaho Department of Labor.

Registered Apprenticeship is a national and state program with more than 29,000 apprenticeship programs providing education and training to more than 500,000 apprentices.

Registered Apprenticeship operates in cooperation with state agencies, employers andeducational institutions.

In Idaho, more than 250 employers, associations and labor unions have implemented apprenticeship programs.

Sandpoint High School hosted the presentationby Russ on Wednesdaybecause, in coordination with Nayla Morton's career pathways class, students have an opportunity to join the Youth Registered Apprenticeship program.

""What Sandpoint High School wants to do is get more of these registered apprenticeships so we can send students out and then hopefully retain them, keep them here,"" Morton said.

SHS Counselor Jeralyn Mire said when she learned about the program, she wanted to extend the knowledge to more local businesses in the community as well.

For that reason,a fewlocalemployersattendedthe presentation to learn more about implementing apprenticeships into their businesses.

Russ said the fastest growing apprenticeable occupations right now are in the technology sector.

IDL specialists are trying to get more Idaho businesses from all sectors involved with apprenticeships.

A Registered Apprenticeship is a standard that is set by the company with the help of education and on the job training, Russ said.

He said, see the program as a threat to continued education.

""A Registered Apprenticeship is not taking anything away from continued education,"" Russ said.

""If anything, it is enhancing that push toward continued education, because we want our youth, our young adults, we want our working people to continue that education.""

In the youth program, students are hired as an apprentice while they are still in high school.

One local business already in the program is Idaho Forest Group.

""We recognized a need to get a pipeline going for our skilled trades, specifically our maintenance mechanic or millwright program,"" said BrianRiley, IFG manager.

""There wasn't a lot options out there other than North Idaho College ... There wasn't a lot of available, trained students coming out that could even step in at an entry level role for us.""

Riley said the first apprentice they received from SHS was a senior in high school, andis now attending North Idaho College while working full time at IFG. Their most recent apprentice is still a senior at SHS. ""All in all, it's working out well for us,"" Riley said.

The average retention rate for employees through the program is 91 percent, Russ said.

A recent study shows that for every $1 invested in an apprentice, employers can expect $1.47 in return.

""We are not in the habit of tellingyou it's the best investment in the world, but I think it's the best investment in the world,"" Russ said.

There is a team set up statewide to help employers implement a Registered Apprenticeship program, Russ said, and the team will do ""Most of the leg work.""

Local businesses interested in the program should contact Lasso at 208-457-8789 ext."
10,Staff,1/26/18 5:11 PM,"The two additions to the New Mexico Information Technology Apprenticeship Program were recently approved by the state Department of Workforce Solutions.

CNM is looking for employers who ""Could be well-served by apprentices in these two fields,"" the school said in a news release.

""The college has dozens of apprentice candidates lined up and ready to support the cyber security and medical coding needs of local employers,"" the news release said.

About 30 people already are serving apprenticeships in other disciplines with another 10 set to begin soon, according to a CNM spokesman.

About a quarter were already CNM students with the rest recruited through outreach efforts at job fairs and in ""Under-represented communities.""

The internship program for IT careers is funded by a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor.

CNM was among 46 institutions nationwide to receive part of the Labor Department's $175 million American Apprenticeship Grants Initiative in 2016.

Apprentices get on-the-job training, take CNM classes funded through the grant and receive industry certifications such as Network+ and Security+.

The goal of CNM's grant is to train 300 apprentices over five years as a way to boost the IT workforce in New Mexico.

The grant also provides money to employers to offset training costs.

Apprentices are assigned career and academic coaches.

The first cohort of apprentices will graduate from the program next month.

Employers who want to participate in the program can review ru00e9sumu00e9s for apprenticeship applicants and decide who they would like to interview."
14,Jonathon Ambarian - MTN News,1/28/18 8:02 PM,"HELENA - The Montana Carpenters' Joint Apprenticeship Training Center in Helena welcomed the public Thursday for an open house.

It was an opportunity for the carpenters' union to show off the newly refurbished facility.

""A few months back, we decided to remodel our facility,"" said Mario Martinez, lead representative for the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters.

""It was really looking old, dated and wasn't meeting the needs of the industry anymore.""

Leaders say the training center is key to sustaining a skilled workforce in Montana.

Apprentices are able to learn their trade while working under the supervision of experienced carpenters and earning a salary.

""The apprentices are schooled on safety, first aid, CPR, metal studs, drywall, acoustical ceilings, bridge building, concrete forms - you name it,"" said Martinez.

At the end of the four years, apprentices become journeymen carpenters, with the experience they need to take on a variety of construction jobs.

""What you have by having gone through the apprenticeship is you've proved that you have the skills to do the job when you get there,"" said Al Ekblad, executive secretary of the Montana State AFL-CIO. ""If you don't have that training, you're walking in the door and competing with everybody else.""

Martinez said 39 people are currently going through the carpenters' apprenticeship program.

""We'd like to see that number grow, and that was one of the reasons for this open house,"" he said.

Leaders sent invitations to elected leaders and school districts around Montana.

Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney visited the training center Thursday, along with state lawmakers and representatives from Attorney General Tim Fox's office.

Teachers and students from high school construction technology programs were also in attendance.

They came from large cities like Billings and Missoula and from small communities like Darby and Brockton.

The students got a look at some up-to-date technology, from virtual welding simulators to laser measuring tools.

Training center leaders highlighted the Career Connections program, a special curriculum to give high schoolers basic skills they will need to be successful apprentices.

""The students are job-ready when they come out,"" said Martinez.

The centers also offers a pre-apprenticeship program, to make sure that people who start apprenticeships know what will be expected of them.

Leaders say too many apprentices drop out after the first or second year.

An August report from the Montana Department of Labor and Industries says the construction industry is the state's fastest-growing.

It projects construction employment to increase 2.7% annually - an additional 815 jobs each year.

Training center leaders also said many of Montana's current trained carpenters are likely to retire in the coming years.

That will leave a lot of opportunity for young people willing to work hard.

""The sky is the limit for them,"" Martinez said.

""As long as they're showing up for work on time, ready to have good attitudes and be productive, they can go anywhere in this industry.""

The training center remodel was funded by contributions from working carpenters around the state.

The union's members pay into a training fund for each hour they work."
18,Staff,1/30/2018 12:30,"ASHEBORO - High school juniors and seniors have another option to further their education in Randolph County, thanks to a collaboration with Asheboro City Schools, Randolph Community College, the Randolph County School System and local manufacturers.

Apprenticeship Randolph, in its second year, allows students the opportunity to earn while they learn, following a machining or mechatronics curriculum and applying their new skills at their industry.

Apprenticeship Randolph was developed to address the manufacturing needs of Randolph County, giving students a jump-start on a professional career in local industries.

Students have the opportunity to maximize earning potential, gain valuable skills, receive on-the-job training and earn an Associate of Applied Science degree in Manufacturing Technology from RCC. Graduates of this four-year program will also earn a Journeyman Certificate issued by the N.C. Department of Labor and the N.C. Community College System.

Tuition, books and fees are covered for selected Apprenticeship Randolph students.

In 2017, its inaugural year, 16 apprentices were signed, working in 11 local industries.

Information sessions will also be held during the school days at each of the high schools until Tuesday, Feb. 6.

24,B.C. Manion,1/31/2018 13:40,"That's just four of the more than 50 graduates who received their diplomas during the 2018 Commencement Ceremony on Jan. 25 at the Center for the Arts at Wesley Chapel.

Others had finished the cosmetology program or Early Childhood Apprenticeship.

There were some receiving high school diplomas, either finishing up credits they needed, or graduating ahead of their class.

All of the graduates had something in common: They smiled broadly as they marched into the auditorium, as members of the audience clapped and cheered.

Graduate Hailey Pecora, of Dade City, plans to enroll at Pasco-Hernando State College, to pursue a degree in nursing.

""She has done this graduation thing at 16. She's already enrolled in college.""

Next, the 44-year-old plans to earn her associate's degree, at either Saint Leo University or Pasco-Hernando State College.

He was pleased to be moving onto the next step, and to have his parents, grandparents and best friend there to help him mark the accomplishment.

Sandra Vogel, a school counselor for adult education, simply loves graduation ceremonies.

""It gives you a warm feeling because you know what they've gone through to get here.""

""They've worked really hard, and we're really proud of them,"" Vogel said.

Leslie Ruttle, a resource teacher, said that besides recognizing the graduates, the ceremony can serve as a stimulant for others.

""A lot of our students, the way we get them, it is word of mouth. A relative, or a friend, or something like that has gone through the program,"" Ruttle said.

""We'll get some students tonight,"" she predicted.

""They'll come here, and they'll see other people have been successful and they'll think: 'I can do it, too.'"".

""So many of the students have gone through trials,"" said Wendy Beard, program manager for adult education.

Throughout the auditorium, there were family members, friends and fellow students cheering on the graduates.

Ambrose Helms, 17, of Wesley Chapel had a giant fan club.

Roughly 30 people were expected to come help him celebrate.

""I feel excited because he's graduating early,"" said Latoya Lovett, his cousin, who had staked out a place near the front of the auditorium for Helms' supporters.

Nicole Robinson was there to support Olivia Paradilla, a graduate from Land O' Lakes High.

""She's my best friend. I know she'll do great things,"" Robinson said.

Catherine Agovino came to support Niki Atkins and Danielle Cary, who had completed their Early Childhood Apprenticeship.

""It's a big accomplishment,"" Agovino said.

Hope Corcoran, who delivered the student address, underscored the reality that high school is not a perfect fit for everyone.

She was born in China, where she was abandoned, as an infant, on the side of the road. She was adopted and attended schools in Wesley Chapel.

""It didn't go as I would have liked,"" Corcoran said.

""I felt like I didn't fit in. I was constantly bullied and teased. I would come home crying to my mom, and I told her I didn't want to go back because I felt so different from the other kids.""

""I was made fun of for being overweight and for having slanted eyes,"" she said.

""It got to a point where I ended up enrolling into home-school,"" she said.

""And, then I found out about the GED program and that I could finish high school and get my diploma.""

""It was through this program that I met Miss Linda Rockwell.""

""I'm so thankful that I had the opportunity to meet this incredible woman. She cares about her students and wants to see them achieve the best future possible,"" Corcoran said.

Along the way, Corcoran said she learned some lessons.

""I have learned that people drop out for different reasons. Sometimes bullying. Sometimes academic reasons and family struggles. Everyone has their own story.""

""Many students feel lost in high school and don't know where to begin. There are so many things that go on, behind the scenes, that we are unaware of.""

""It's expected that students all learn the same way, with the same lessons, same techniques and same books, when that is simply not the case. High school isn't for everyone.""

""Some students have jobs, to help support their families. Or, need to stay home to take care of them, along with other responsibilities, outside of school that can get in the way of academic work,"" Corcoran said.

""A few nights ago, I was texting Miss Rockwell and I was telling her I wasn't sure what else I should talk about. Her response was: 'Talk about how there's more than one path to success. How each person chooses their path. You can talk about how not everyone has the same definition of success, and that getting a GED is just the first step to success.'"".

Corcoran observed: ""I couldn't have said it better myself."""
25,Staff,1/31/2018 14:21,"While Phaze Concrete has been around for over a decade, they have set the bar for outstanding concrete work.

It's the way they have treated and helped the employees that have helped them gain additional recognition.

The concrete construction business has offices in numerous locations in the western portion of the United States.

The company has a license to deliver their services to 17 states across the country.

The bulk of their work focuses on Utah, California, and Nevada.

Starting with small projects that included working on residential properties and pouring driveways.

The team that started the company became successful because of their hard work and assistance in the concrete industry.

The business grew slowly, but in a few years, they began to attract bigger and lucrative projects.

Their work on residential properties became replaced with large commercial projects.

These massive structures included parking garages, box stores, and multilevel buildings.

One major project landed by Phaze Concrete was a Family Dollar distribution center.

The contract gained the company pouring concrete for a million square foot structure.

While this project allowed the company to collect a large sum of money, it earned other honors.

Their work on the distribution center earned Phaze the ACI Intermountain Chapter Award of Excellence in flatwork and tilt-up concrete work.

Because of these contracts and honors, the company has over 250 team members.

Because of the significant staff, they can work on multiple projects in concrete, utilities, and earthwork in their area.

Just because the company has multiple projects completed at once does not mean the quality and quickness decreases.

The crew members are dedicated to finishing jobs ahead of schedule and within budget.

Phaze Concrete is committed to improving the quality of their work and increasing efficiency.

To achieve this, crew members ensure that they work together as a team.

They create a safe, professional, and enjoyable atmosphere where every member wants to work.

The safety of all employees is an essential aspect of the company.

That is why the company has an Experience Modification rating of 0.72%, which means they are committed to the safety of their team members.

While Phaze ensures all work crew members are safe on the job, it's their commitment outside the worksite that is turning heads.

In 2016, the company joined forces with the Department of Labor's Department of Apprenticeships.

This partnership created an exciting and unique work education program for Phaze team members.

The decision to partner has been successful while providing young workers with high-quality work experience.

Government officials have highlighted the importance of these type of offerings for workers.

Alexander Acosta, U.S. Secretary of Labor, showed support of the initiative at the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers' Meeting in 2017.

The White House Office of American Innovation has become equally committed to supporting these types of programs.

As of today, the apprenticeships program by Phaze Concrete is one of 37,000 different sponsors in the country.

The company has become proud of the fact that their programs are not seen as a union organization benefit, mainly since Phaze stands as not unionized.

Instead, the company wants to stay focused on ensuring all team members can learn the trade and progress in the industry.

It's because of the commitment the company has for their employees to learn new trades that they are leading the concrete industry.

Employees are safely completing massive projects ahead of schedule but also making sure all team members are learning on the job.

28,Ed Central,2/1/2018 6:40,"duced"":""11%"",""sm_api_title"":""Head Start Apprenticeship in California"",""sm_api_content"":"" Claudia Campbell had tried several times to build her business as an in-home child care provider.

She had also always wanted to go back to school to learn more about child development, but taking on those obligations was difficult as she was working at several different jobs to make ends meet.

""I've had my own children, and have taken care of others, but I've never had the education behind it,"" Campbell said.

Through her local public housing authority, Campbell heard about a unique free apprenticeship for early childhood workers.

Today, she has completed 24 child development courses and nine general education courses toward her associate's degree while working part-time as a substitute at a Head Start in Hayward, Calif. She goes to school four hours each day and works for another three and a half.

Eventually, she hopes to be hired as a family advocate for Head Start.

Campbell is part of a group of child care workers who are taking advantage of a program run by the YMCA of the East Bay - Early Childhood Impact in Northern California and the Service Employees International Union's Early Educator Training Center.

The program is operated in partnership with local colleges and universities and other Head Start employers.

In the nine-month work-study program, Head Start parents earn a California Child Development Associate Teacher Permit.

The permit functions as an entry to the early childhood field, allowing them to work as full-time Head Start assistant teachers.

Participants can attain an associate's degree in child development or a bachelor's degree, credentials that continue to help Head Start grantees to meet the 2007 federal requirement that stipulates that more than half of all Head Start teachers must have a bachelor's degree in early childhood, child development or equivalent coursework.

Mothers with their children in tow are tackling early literacy development at a local school.

They're keeping busy eating Cheetos and playing on mobile devices or with coloring sheets while their moms learn about the ""Serve and return"" of teacher-child interactions.

This is the final session of the weekly, semester-long course in Principles and Practices in Early Childhood Education as part of the Head Start Apprenticeship.

Many of the women have been at work or caring for children much of the day, and they're discussing the importance of reading with children as young as infancy.

Most are nontraditional students-low income, juggling work and family, and maybe the first in their families to attend college.

Most are already employed at Head Starts as substitutes or teachers aids.

For some, English is a second language and bilingual students occasionally translate for their peers whose English isn't as strong.

""Ortensia are you taking a break? Let's talk because next semester we do have child care for you and we do have tutoring on Saturday.""

The Head Start Apprenticeship is designed to help solve a growing problem in California: the lack of early childhood teachers.

Experts say there are only enough licensed child care spaces for 25 percent of the children in the state who potentially need services while their parents work.

This shortage comes at a time when state and federal governments are placing higher expectations on teachers of young children as policymakers come to understand more about brain development and the importance of learning in the first years of life.

The apprenticeship is therefore designed to address the conundrum of requiring more from those who care for young children but offering few options to train them.

New America's recent paper, Re-thinking Credential Requirements in Early Education: Equity-Based Strategies for Professionalizing a Vulnerable Workforce, describes apprenticeship as an option for training members of the current workforce, many of whom are low-income and women of color, and who are more likely to be shut out of professional learning opportunities because they cannot afford them.

The Head Start Apprenticeship is successful, says Randi Wolfe, who designed the program for SEIU, because its design meets the specific needs of nontraditional students.

""All of our workers are all low income. A lot of them are recent immigrants or one generation back or first generation college students,"" she said.

The Head Start Apprenticeship provides no-cost college courses and textbooks and offers classes at times and in locations that work well with students' work schedules and family responsibilities.

The apprenticeship also provides child care, transportation, and tutoring to help remove the barriers that adult students often face to course completion.

The YMCA's Workforce Development Director Joya Chavarin says she's observed students forming close relationships that form as organic learning communities and support structures.

""Students decided to stay after class and study together,"" she said.

""It was fantastic because many of the students enrolled alone, but through participation in the apprenticeship they develop collegial relationships that strengthen their success as teachers.""

Chavarin also notes that 95 percent of her adult students are parents of children under 12.

Many students she said relied on and reflected upon their experiences as children and parents while taking the courses, which also was an important asset and contributor to their success.

The workforce development community is taking note as it seeks to expand apprenticeship models that pair structured on-the-job learning with coaching and mentoring into new sectors and populations.

""Now that we have this in place,"" Wolfe said, ""I'm getting phone calls from community colleges and places around the state saying, 'We're interested in starting an apprenticeship. Can you help us?'"".

This is not the only apprenticeship program for early childhood workers that SEIU and their partners have developed.

A program for center-based child care workers with the Mexican American Opportunities Foundation in Southeast Los Angeles provides on-site mentoring, supervision, and college classes to assistant or associate teachers of preschool-aged children.

Another program in the San Fernando and Antelope Valleys in Los Angeles County provides training, coaching, and no-cost college coursework to family child care providers.

She says she has learned so much already from her coursework, things she wishes she had known even before she became a parent-about temperament, development, the importance of listening to kids, and how to support diverse families.

""I wish I could have taken these classes before I came a parentI had a hard time listening to my kids. I shut them down because I'm the parent and whatever I say goes. That's one of the things I've learned, you have to let your child be heard and there are times when they are right."""
33,Staff,2/2/2018 0:00,"duced"":""3%"",""sm_api_title"":""Apprenticeships Focus of Contractor Watchdog Listening Sessions"",""sm_api_content"":"" Overtures for collaboration and an interest in workforce development were the stakeholders' takeaways from three listening sessions held by the freshly instated head of the Labor Department's federal contractor watchdog agency.

w. Select federal contractors, civil rights groups, and membership association representatives were granted an exclusive opportunity to sit down with Ondray Harris, the new Trump-appointed director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

The position had sat open for more than a year during the presidential transition, sowing some unease among the federal contractor community over the office's transparency, efficiency, and commitment to affirmative action priorities.

The listening sessions centered around four broad categories: apprenticeship programs, recognition for employers doing well, compliance evaluations, and disability outreach and recruitment.

Workforce development through apprenticeship is a priority for Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.

Harris shares his boss's passion for apprenticeships and discussed how they could assist employers in achieving diversity goals while simultaneously addressing a skills gap in the U.S. workforce, Mickey Silberman, chair of the affirmative action and pay equity practice at Fortney & Scott LLC and co-chair of the Institute for Workplace Equality, told Bloomberg Law.

The OFCCP annually audits between 1 percent and 2 percent of about 200,000 federal contractor facilities to confirm and enforce compliance with three federal equal employment opportunity laws: Executive Order 11,246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Section 4212 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act.

Detailed policy matters weren't a focus of the listening meetings and Harris reportedly asked attendees to keep the particulars off the record, sources tell Bloomberg Law.

The Department of Labor's Office of Public Affairs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Harris and his senior adviser, Craig Leen, are still getting their OFCCP sea legs, but they were attentive to stakeholder concerns and expressed a desire to take a fresh approach to the agency's mission, sources tell Bloomberg Law.

""Director Harris and Mr. Leen were seeking insights and experience from the attendees with the stated goal of making the OFCCP more effective and efficient,"" said Mickey Silberman, chair of the affirmative action and pay equity practice at Fortney & Scott LLC and co-chair of the Institute for Workplace Equality.

Other stakeholders speaking to Bloomberg Law repeated similar sentiments.

Harris and Leen took a step back from regulatory minutiae to talk big picture concepts and themes, which one source who asked not to be named found ""Refreshing.""

Leen was floated as a potential OFCCP director before the Trump administration settled on Harris.

If his engagement at the meetings is anything to go by, Leen will be a major OFCCP player alongside Harris going forward.

Candee Chambers, executive director of DirectEmployers in Indianapolis, told Bloomberg Law that ""Even though the unemployment rate is low, there are still over 6 million jobs available and the US is currently facing a skills gap that will not allow for those jobs to be filled."" Chambers attended one of the listening sessions with other membership association representatives.

""You can increase diversity and build opportunities through appropriate education and training for females, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities, helping them gain the skills they need to be qualified for higher-level positions while also providing a pipeline for companies not currently working at capacity,"" Chambers said.

There still exists a question of how apprenticeships and workforce development programs fit with the OFCCP's central mission of evaluating federal contractors and enforcing compliance with federal equal opportunity laws.

The potential mismatch didn't appear to bother employer-side sources speaking with Bloomberg Law, however.

The office needs a breath of fresh air and re-prioritization, and employers consider the positive dialogue a satisfying step forward into the new year, they said.

New leadership will, with any luck, guide the OFCCP through the rapids it finds itself in.

The office last year nearly found itself merged with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Concerns still linger over agency transparency and efficiency, especially after staff were offered buyouts to shrink the agency.

Director Harris will likely be managing these issues amid a significant budget cut.

The exact number won't be known until Congress finalizes a budget, but the White House had proposed funding the OFCCP at $88 million-a $17 million decrease from its FY 2017 funding of $105 million.

The office plans to establish two skilled regional centers and staff them with specially trained personnel to carry out its compliance evaluations, according to its FY 2018 Congressional Budget Justification.

That document was published in 2017 when the OFCCP lacked a politically appointed director.

The skilled regional centers are intended to increase case evaluation quality, timeliness, and efficient use of limited resources while reducing the need for the ""Network"" of district and field offices that currently audit federal contractor facilities.

Completing the Federal Contractor Compliance Manual and finalizing the compliance officer training program are two other OFCCP priorities.

The FY 2018 Budget Justification indicates that the office is moving toward a centralized model of compliance enforcement and away from the disparate regional network it currently manages.

With a new director at the wheel, these plans can pick up steam or go off on a new direction entirely."

The single mother of two has been hauling freight for three years, benefiting from a national trucker shortage that has companies scrambling to recruit drivers, offering competitive salaries and benefits and, in some cases, paying for their training.

Know from listening to other people how cool it is that their mom does this, but they don't like my work hours.

Duck works 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. five days a week, taking time away from her two young daughters and limiting her social life.

It's hard to find healthy food along the interstate, she said, and you don't get much exercise sitting in a truck.

Duck owns a home and a nice vehicle, and she sleeps in her own bed, unlike ""Over-the-road"" drivers who can be gone one, two or three weeks at a time.

""(My daughters) know from listening to other people how cool it is that their mom does this, but they don't like my work hours,"" she said.

""They don't like how much I work.""

A study conducted last year by Bob Costello, chief economist for American Trucking Associations, estimated the driver shortage would reach 50,000 by the end of 2017 and 174,000 by 2026.

Costello cited several reasons, including a workforce that is aging and overwhelmingly male; recruitment challenges related to the trucking lifestyle, which doesn't appeal to everyone; and new regulations that limit shift lengths, requiring more drivers to haul the same amount of freight.

""At the same time, it's a growing industry, so you have new positions. There is work available for anyone who has a commercial driver's license right now, assuming you don't have a criminal record.""

Depending on the company, starting salaries range from $35,000 to $40,000 a year for route drivers who go home each night and more for regional or cross-country, Reinert said.

""Employers are falling all over themselves to hire students,"" said Rene Dulle, Workforce Solutions Group program manager at St. Louis Community College who oversees its truck-driving program on the Forest Park campus.

Truckers must be 21 years old and possess a Class A commercial driver's license to take tractor-trailers across state lines.

The minimum age is 18 for a Class B license to drive heavy trucks with no trailers.

Illinois and Missouri require physical exams and drug testing, Dulle said, and most trucking companies want verifiable work histories and acceptable driving records.

""You can't drive with certain heart conditions,"" Reinert said.

Two community colleges and a few private schools in the St. Louis area have truck-driving programs, which vary on the number of weeks, tuition and pass rates on licensing tests.

Lewis and Clark and St. Louis Community College got into the field three years ago after joining seven other colleges in eight states along the Mississippi River and successfully applying for a $24 million U.S. Department of Labor grant to offset costs.

""We knew there was a huge demand for truck drivers before that,"" Dulle said.

St. Louis Community College has a regular program and a new pilot apprenticeship program.

The latter provides free tuition for five weeks of training to selected students who commit to working a minimum of 18 months for one of three partnering freight haulers.

Apprenticeships are funded by a federal grant administered by the St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment and sponsored by St. Louis Regional Freightway, a branch of Bi-State Development that assists the manufacturing, logistics and transportation industry.

""We want to increase the number of truck drivers and continue to have competitive trucking rates and be competitive in the global market,"" said Mary Lamie, executive director of St. Louis Regional Freightway.

Lead instructor for St. Louis Community College classes is Seth Owens, 38, of Belleville, who covered more than a million miles during his 13 years as a trucker.

Today, he teaches students how to drive and back up tractor-trailers under all kinds of circumstances and do thorough pre-trip inspections.

""You have to press the clutch to remove it from a given gear, and then you have to press it again to put it in a different gear,"" said fellow instructor Jimmy Sherman, 39, of St. Louis.

Student John Schmidt, 23, of Kirkwood, Missouri, wants to get a commercial driver's license because he helps with his grandparents' farm and needs to haul large loads.

Student Brandon Coyle, 26, of St. Charles, Missouri, has been working in the restaurant industry for 10 years and hating it for eight years.

Government limits time on road. In recent years, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has imposed stricter truck-driving rules to reduce fatigue and improve safety.

Work weeks are limited to 70 hours, work days to 14 hours and driving times to 11 hours.

That's one of the reasons we have a driver shortage.

Companies can't cook the books, so it takes more drivers and more trucks to move the same amount of freight.

""That's one of the reasons we have a driver shortage,"" Owens said.

""Companies can't cook the books, so it takes more drivers and more trucks to move the same amount of freight.""

Emily Duck graduated from Belleville West in 2007 and worked in stores, restaurants and bars before going to truck-driving school in California and landing a well-paying job in three days.

Since that time, Duck has worked for four companies, hauling everything from soap to sandwiches, almonds to ammunition in tractor-trailers more than 60 feet long.

Beyond driving, Duck inspects the big rig at the start of each shift, popping the hood of its 13-foot-tall cab and checking oil, belts, hoses, tires and an air system that powers brakes, suspension, even the driver's seat.

After her overnight shift ends, Duck sleeps a couple of hours before getting her two daughters, Norah, 6, and Aiko, 7, up and off to school.

""There's 80,000 pounds in your control, and to be able to operate the truck and work the hours ... It takes a lot out of a person. Not everyone can do it."""
39,Karen Florin,2/3/2018 16:01,"duced"":""0%"",""sm_api_title"":""Braille program to offer York inmates job, purpose"",""sm_api_content"":"" Cynthia Stubbs walked out of the South Carolina prison where she had served 14 years for drug and gun trafficking, and within a month of her 2011 release, the 53-year-old was back inside a prison in North Carolina.

This time, she walked through the gates as an employee.

She manages male inmates in a prison Braille program that provides tactile literature and graphics to people who are blind or visually impaired.

Anita McGraw, 60, also learned to transcribe Braille while serving a lengthy sentence in the Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood, S.C., for a drunken driving accident that caused a death.

She was released on parole last year to an apprenticeship program in Kentucky and now has her own business producing Braille products.

On Wednesday, she said she filed her income taxes, becoming a contributor for the first time in 16 years rather than a burden on the system.

""I promise you, if it were not for the Braille program, I would probably be homeless right now,"" McGraw said in a phone interview.

She was a registered nurse, but returning to that career was not an option due to her felony conviction.

The two women participated in the American Printing House for the Blind's prison Braille program, which the Louisville-based nonprofit announced this past week is coming to the Janet S. York Correctional Institution in East Lyme.

Within the next couple of months, a select group of about 10 of the women's prison inmates will begin learning Braille, a system of raised dots that allows those who can't see well, or at all, to take in words and graphics.

After about a year, the women will become certified by the Library of Congress and start learning the Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics.

They'll eventually produce textbooks and graphics for Connecticut students who are blind or visually impaired in grades kindergarten to 12.

The prison Braille program at York will be a partnership between the American Printing House for the Blind, Department of Correction and the state Department of Rehabilitation Services' Bureau of Education and Services for the Blind.

The J. Walton Bissell Foundation of West Hartford awarded APH a $26,000 grant to buy computers and other equipment needed to launch the program, including a Perkins Braille embosser, translation software and Braille paper.

Said Nancy Mothersele, Braille coordinator for the Bureau of Education and Services for the Blind.

""It's a win-win situation. They're giving back to the kids and learning a unique skill that is really needed.""

Mothersele said a Braille program has operated out of the Cheshire Correctional Institution, a state prison for men, since 1996, but has been reduced in size as the male prisoners were released or transferred to other facilities.

York is the only state prison for women in Connecticut, so there's little risk of the women in the Braille program being transferred.

Mothersele said, there is a ""Beautiful spot"" on the Niantic prison grounds for a Braille shop.

The remaining Braille prison workers at Cheshire - many have been released to employment in the industry, she said - will be proofing the work of the female inmates at York, she said.

State officials expect that the prison Braille program, which eventually could expand to produce materials for other states, would save money.

Connecticut also no longer would have to purchase the Braille products from an outside source.

Mothersele said 70 to 80 school-age children in Connecticut use Braille and require a variety of products.

While software now enables the digital transcription of print to Braille, workers need to know how to code and format Braille files before they are sent to an embosser, which is a machine that produces Braille.

The American Printing House for the Blind has since 1879 received funds from Congress to research, develop and manufacture educational aids for people below the college level who are blind or visually impaired.

Other organizations had prison Braille programs, and in 2000, APH started its own in the Kentucky Correctional Institution for Women.

There are now 40 prison Braille programs across the country, and each October, APH hosts a conference for members of the National Prison Braille Network.

""I've traveled to many prison Braille programs over the years,"" said Jayma Hawkins, coordinator of the National Prison Braille Program for APH. ""The most consistent feedback I get is that it heals them. These are grown men in Folsom Prison. And they grow them big there. Men and women both, when they touch their first dot of Braille, it starts to heal them. It touches a place in their heart they never knew they had."".

J. Gary Mudd, vice president of public affairs for APH, said he learned Braille after he went blind at 12 years old.

""You go from reading with your eyes to reading with your fingers. Regardless of what people may think, your sense of touch does not get better if you go blind.""

The APH has a nationwide re-entry program for prisoners called the Braille Transcriber Apprenticeship Program.

Prison Braille workers who are released on parole go to Louisville for a two- to six-month program to refine their skills.

If they want to go into business for themselves, APH helps them obtain a license and sends them home with a laptop, Braille software and their first contract to produce a Braille textbook.

Some of the apprentices go to work full-time for APH, which employs 300 people and produces talking books, Braille menus and other products in addition to textbooks and graphics.

""In our 17 years of being involved with prison Braille all over the country, the recidivism rate is practically nothing,"" Mudd said.

""They have involvement in something valuable to them and they have skills they can market.""

Stubbs, the prison Braille graduate who now works at the Scotland Correctional Institution in Laurinburg, managed up to 33 workers, some of them serving life sentences.

She said she had made up her mind to change her lifestyle as soon as the judge banged the gavel and sentenced her to 16 years away from her children.

""I just can't begin to tell you how it makes you feel to know you are sitting in prison and you're responsible for a child or student being able to get their education because of what you're doing,"" she said.

""I couldn't think of any way to give back other than what I was doing. That encouraged me to take it as far as I could."""

Germany-style vocational training and re-training might help if only there weren't American culture and politics.

The EIC exemplifies a tradition in this former steel town of companies and colleges working together for the good of the community.

Pittsburgh's EIC was also inspired by Germany's dual-education model, a form of apprenticeship where students go to vocational school, while also working in a related and paid job in a factory.

Such apprenticeship schemes are slowly but surely making a comeback in the United States, supported on both sides of the political aisle as a promising way to get students out of debt and out-of-luck workers into new jobs.

In theory, companies, educators, state governments, Congress and the Trump administration should all work together, with their common goal to train skilled workers for the next generation.

Americans, more than Germans, remain wedded to the dream of going to college.

In America's polarized politics, apprenticeships have instead become yet another proxy war for the agendas of various competing lobbies.

Trade unions see apprenticeships as their last hope of stemming the decline in unionization.

Teachers' unions are leery of public money being diverted from schools to apprenticeships.

Democrats expect apprenticeship programs to lift minorities out of poverty; Republicans talk of the ""Forgotten middle"" of rural America.

""As a whole, Germans still value the ability to work with your hands and see that as a desirable skill,"" says Anthony Ponder, dean of the STEM program of Sinclair Community College, which is pioneering an apprenticeship program with five companies in southern Ohio.

Only about one third of Americans actually complete a college degree.

""So you're basically saying to two thirds of Americans that 'you're a loser,'"" says Joseph Fuller, co-head of Harvard Business School's Managing the Future of Work Project.

Donald Trump and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, held meetings with German CEOs during their first trip to Germany last year.

Ms. Trump, who visited a Siemens plant to get a closer look, said she would take ""Many good ideas"" back to the US. Mr. Trump then said that the word ""Apprentice"" had a nice ring to it.

In June, he signed an executive order directing the federal government to expand apprenticeships.

He set up a German-American taskforce to explore worker retraining options and promised $90 million for apprenticeships in 2016.

On the German side, the new taskforce includes the education ministry; on the American side, it's led by the Department of Labor.

Yet everyone agrees that more apprenticeships would be a good thing.

Companies complain about being forced to over-pay for hiring graduates for skilled trade jobs.

Some of those hires could have been spared that college debt by going through a vocational training program instead. About 500,000 Americans did some form of apprenticeship last year.

So there's certainly plenty of potential: A study co-authored by Mr. Fuller of Harvard University identified about 3.2 million job openings in the US across 74 occupational sectors that could benefit from apprenticeships.

Germany has long traditions of apprenticeships and vocational schools, which already start at the high-school level.

Students are encouraged to move into skilled trades, and there's less stigma surrounding blue-collar work.

Apprenticeship programs in the US are - surprise - often run by German companies.

Volkswagen started an apprenticeship program five years ago at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Altogether about 528 people are currently being educated according to the German education model.

With unemployment in the US at a 17-year low, and manufacturing becoming more and more of a high-tech world, companies across rural America complain about a lack of skilled workers to fill openings.

""The number one topic that companies bring up today is access to talent,"" says Mindy McLaughlin of Team NEO, an economic development group in northern Ohio.

The companies that complain the least, she says, tend to be German subsidiaries ones that ""Find a way to make apprenticeships work in an American context.""

With little existing infrastructure or federal support, companies often have to develop their own programs, all the while with ""a risk that other companies could take advantage of that,"" said Marc McGrath, an American who heads up the US automotive division of German car parts supplier Schaeffler, which has been running an apprenticeship program in the US since the early 1980s.

In most cases, companies pick their own employees to rise from the shop floor to higher positions.

Rewarding good work helps build loyalty and retention.

Many US rivals, by comparison, see apprenticeships as a luxury - one of the first things to go in a downturn - rather than something that can help them keep talent for the long haul.

A few American companies are trying to emulate the Germans.

An apprenticeship program by VEKA, a German maker of windows and doors, is ""Age-independent"" and has included military veterans and former policemen, according to Joe Peilert, North American president.

Others see an opportunity for rural Americans who have found themselves out of a job but have years of middle-management experience.

Students coming out of university ""Won't be ready to take on the jobs of baby boomers,"" says Rebecca Lucore, head of corporate social responsibility in North America at Covestro, a spinoff of German chemicals firm Bayer.

As a result, Covestro's apprenticeship program has focused on ""Down on their luck"" adults returning to the workforce.

This German idea could yet help to solve what Mr. Trump calls ""American carnage."""
46,Fitzgerald Washington,2/5/2018 14:14,"duced"":""20%"",""sm_api_title"":""MY TURN: 2017 was a record-setting year for employment in Alabama"",""sm_api_content"":"" Every year at this time, I like look back at what was accomplished in the preceding year regarding our economy and the status of our state's job market.

I'm proud to say that 2017 was a record-setting year for the Alabama Department of Labor in many ways.

For many years, we talked about reaching a milestone - a milestone that would mean Alabama was as close to what is known as ""Full employment"" as it could be.

You'd be hard-pressed to get any economist to give you a figure for an unemployment rate that defines full employment, but it's a little easier to determine full employment based on the number of jobs an economy is supporting.

Here in Alabama, that magic number is 2 million jobs.

If our employers can support 2 million jobs, most will agree that we're in a really good place.

Until last year, Alabama had only supported 2 million or more jobs for five months, way back in 2007, well before the Great Recession.

For nearly 10 long years, that milestone was just a little glimmer, always seemingly out of reach - until April 2017.

For every month that followed, our economy supported more than 2 million jobs, ending with December's count of 2,025,100, the third highest in Alabama's history.

At the beginning of 2017, I said I hoped to surpass economists' predictions regarding the number of jobs our economy would add last year.

We were predicted to add 18,700 jobs last year, and we added 32,500.

Along with this record-setting jobs number, our unemployment rate set record after record last year.

In September, we tied our previous record low unemployment rate of 3.8 percent.

In November, it fell to a record 3.5 percent, which we maintained in December.

In December, 75,698 people were counted as unemployed, the fewest ever recorded.

2,093,063 people were counted as employed, the most ever recorded.

People are working in Alabama at higher rates than ever before.

What kind of jobs are they? Are they quality jobs? Let me answer that - Yes, they are quality jobs.

One of our largest growth sectors in 2017 was manufacturing, with an annual gain of 5,800 jobs.

Alabama had 269,600 manufacturing jobs in December 2017, the most recorded all year, and the most in nearly a decade.

The average weekly earnings for those jobs is $1,049.

The average hourly wage is $24.46, which is also up from last year.

Our construction employment, also a large growth sector, was up 6,100 over the year.

Construction employment has always been an indicator of economic health.

Wages in this sector also increased, with average weekly earnings rising to $954.30, up $64.07 a week from last year, with an average hourly wage of $23.68.

Statewide, workers saw their average weekly earnings rise by more than $30, over all industries.

The good news continues regarding our payments for unemployment compensation benefits.

As our unemployment rate continued its decline, so did our initial claims.

In 2017, Alabamians filed the least number of initial claims since 1973.

Last year, I promised to work to keep 2017's yearly average unemployment rate below 2016's, which was 6.0 percent.

Despite all the good news we've experienced and records we've set over the past year, there is still a great deal of work to do.

We are working closely and deliberately with Gov. Kay Ivey and her administration to make sure that those Alabamians have every opportunity to find work.

We are collaborating with other state agencies, county and municipal governments, and economic development groups to hold job fairs across the state.

In 2017, our regional job fair initiative drew more than 7,000 jobseekers.

More than 600 employers participated in these events, including a first-ever Governor's Disability Job Fair, held in Birmingham.

We're working to encourage both employers and jobseekers to participate in the state's Apprenticeship Alabama program, which provides paid training for workers and allows employers to train their employees, resulting in long-term employment.

Any Alabamian, either jobseeker or employer, should visit one of our 49 career centers located throughout the state for free, personalized assistance.

We offer assistance in ru00e9sumu00e9 writing, interview skills, job searches, vocational and educational assistance, training programs, and more for jobseekers.

For employers, we can help you post jobs, pre-screen applicants and obtain cost saving tax credits and other programs.

""Apprenticeship expansion is a priority for President Trump, as he demonstrated by establishing the task force last summer,"" DeVos said.

""In the State of the Union address, he called on everyone, not just the Department of Education, or Labor, or Congress, or Washington, everyone to invest in workforce development, and job training, and great vocational schools so our students and future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.""

The task force was chartered in accordance with a June executive order, and is now jointly chaired by DeVos, Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.

Other members represent a diverse group of educational, labor and industry interests, focused around the question of how to diversify skills education in the U.S. economy.

Acosta cited the growing ""Skills gap,"" the disparity between the demand for labor with certain skills and the supply of that labor, as the reason for the task force's creation.

""The skills gap is real. It's nearly 6 million individuals, and moving quickly is deeply appreciated by all,"" Acosta said.

A recent analysis from the Manpower Group, a staffing firm which every year conducts a ""Talent shortage survey,"" found that 46 percent of U.S. employers reported having difficulty filling jobs in 2016.

""Skilled trade workers,"" a category defined by Manpower, represented the hardest jobs to fill in the U.S. from 2009 through 2016.

The Department of Labor points to a number of factors driving this ""Skills gap."" Those include: An aging skilled workforce, trouble attracting new talent pools, a mismatch between workers' skills and their credentials, insufficient advancement in talent to keep up with industry's fast pace of development, and a lack of workforce training.

These problems, Secretary DeVos emphasized in her opening statement, must be addressed in order to encourage more successful American workers.

""America must do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st-century economy. We must answer the call to invest in individual students and expand access to more education pathways,"" she said.

This concept of expanding ""Pathways"" is a notable component of President Donald Trump's original executive order constituting the task force, calling as it does for the federal government to ""Provide more affordable pathways to secure, high-paying jobs by promoting apprenticeships and effective workforce development programs, while easing the regulatory burden on such programs and reducing or eliminating taxpayer support for ineffective workforce development programs.""

Tuesday's task force meeting focused on how to make vocational education and apprenticeships a more appealing and successful model for both would-be students and would-be employers.

Subcommittees reports focused on both groups emphasized the need to better match employers' needs with students' skills, making sure that educators know what employers will pay for.

The task force also discussed the value of mentorship programs and paid-work experience, which would allow future employees to make a living while learning valuable workforce skills.

DeVos, in her opening remarks, mentioned the need to make current educational credentials, which do not necessarily signal an employee's real skills, more informative to employers.

""Credentials send important signals to employers. We need to reconsider whether they match what employers need and what employers think those signals mean,"" DeVos said.

Marc Morial, President of the National Urban League, offered a comment early in the meeting about how important he saw apprenticeships as being to the young, predominantly African American people his organization advocates for.

""What excites me about this and what I believe the opportunity is in the apprenticeship arena, is that we have many, many young Americans who have in some cases marginally connected to the workforce,"" Morial said.

""Being marginally connected to the workforce, the way to get them into the workforce is not only by connecting them to a job, but connecting them to an opportunity in which they can enhance their skills. So they have a chance to move into sustainable employment on a long-term basis."""

Michigan is hiring, but many employers struggle to fill open positions and keep them filled.

Much has been written, discussed, and reported about a major skills gap that continues to grow across numerous industry sectors, threatening Michigan's economy from continuing to recover and prosper.

Enter registered apprenticeships to help reduce this gap.

Apprenticeship is a time-tested, but still much misunderstood, talent strategy that has been deemed vital on a national scale, with a nationwide goal of creating 5 million apprenticeships in just five years.

It is an ambitious undertaking but one for which a roadmap is already being put in place here in Michigan.

The Advance Michigan Center for Apprenticeship Innovation, led by the Southeast Michigan Community Alliance and Workforce Intelligence Network, convenes community colleges, local and regional companies, and workforce/economic development partners to greatly expand registered apprenticeships across 13 counties in southeast Michigan.

AMCAI aims to set standards to simplify the process of starting, developing and launching registered apprenticeship programs for employers and, ultimately, grow apprenticeship opportunities regionally and statewide.

Registered, paid apprenticeships are approved by the U.S. Department of Labor, ensuring that skills earned are not only relevant, but also accompanied by a certificate of completion.

As regional partners work to develop a skilled workforce for in-demand occupations, an opportunity lies in this proven model for rapid right skills development and talent retention.

Rather than a consolation prize, apprenticeships should be considered a first choice for those looking to jump-start their careers.

While the process for getting an apprenticeship started is sometimes perceived as intimidating by business owners, AMCAI's efforts help to eliminate barriers to launch and create win-win opportunities with true ROI for employers and apprentices.

This is especially significant as we continue to dispel the misconception many school counselors, parents, and potential apprentices have towards apprenticeships - the false perception that rewarding and lucrative careers are only accessible through a four-year degree or that apprentice positions are only available in back-breaking, ""Dirty fingernail"" occupations.

Rather, apprenticeships are a viable option with long histories of success in industries like manufacturing and construction, while continuing to grow in ""Non-traditional"" sectors such as IT and health care; leading to high-paying careers without the burden of student loan debt.

Employers often reiterate skepticism of the apprenticeship model, albeit for different reasons.

They are concerned their level of investment in developing workplace talent will not be reciprocated: fearing attrition, implementation costs and lack of scalability.

Rather, for every dollar spent on an apprenticeship, employers get an average of $1.47 back, according to the Dept.

Apprenticeships for some occupations - such as millwrights or sheet metal workers - see even greater returns, up to $5 for every dollar spent.

Investing in employees creates loyalty, and 91 percent of apprentices retain employment after their respective program ends.

Though we are making progress, it is clear we have work to do.

A brand new online resource, MIApprenticeship.org, has just been launched along with an Apprenticeship Hotline, to provide information about apprenticeships to stakeholders, employers, potential apprentices, and workforce development professionals.

Achieving proposed targets will take focused support from every stakeholder."

He posted this message at 5:34 p.m. Wednesday on Twitter: ""I put in my two weeks notice. I work at the Department of Labor. There were going to be ICE subpoenas for information that would end up being used to hunt down & deport undocumented workers.""

When contacted at work Thursday morning he said he was unable to talk about his social media comments over state telephones.

Jordon Dyrdahl-Roberts says via Twitter that he is going to quit his state job over federal immigration issues.

Carl Rusnok, regional director of communications for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said he was looking into the issue and would likely comment later.

The Department of Labor said a comment would be forthcoming later in the day.

Shahid Haque, a Helena-based immigration attorney, said in 2012 the state of Montana Unemployment Insurance Division had been illegally disclosing confidential personal information for years.

ICE would request and receive copies of the Quarterly Wage Reports - which had employees' names, Social Security numbers, and salary information - for businesses that were ""Under investigation.""

Haque said Pam Bucy, who served as DOL chief legal counsel prior to serving as its commissioner from 2013-2017, argued that the program is a federal-state effort and claimed that there is an exception written into federal law that allows the wage reports to be sent to the federal government without a warrant.

Galen Hollenbaugh is now serving as DOL commissioner.

It was not clear if Dyrdahl-Roberts' decision was related to this issue.

According to its website, ICE ""Enforces federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety."" It was created in 2003 through a merger of the former U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The Department of Labor and Industry building in Helena will expand the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program.

Dyrdahl-Roberts also tweeted Wednesday: ""This isn't an easy decision as it puts me in a delicate financial position.""

He notes he has a toddler, his wife is unemployed and in graduate school, has two cats and $900 in his checking account.

Dyrdahl-Roberts says on Twitter he started a Paypal account that people can donate to.

69,Staff,2/8/2018 15:24,"duced"":""15%"",""sm_api_title"":""Why Every Company Should Copy Phaze Concrete and Their Employee Treatment"",""sm_api_content"":"" For over a decade, Phaze Concrete has become the leader in concrete construction work in the states of Nevada and Utah.

Beginning with small residential projects in 2003, they worked their way up to more massive structures.

In a short period, Phaze quickly became successful because of the hard work and completing projects ahead of schedule.

Because of these attributes, customers were content and happy with the finished job.

The company began to increase in size, transitioning to commercial projects.

These commercial projects consisted of parking garages and large box stores.

Over time, Phaze Concrete expanded into more western states, working on more projects.

Two reasons why Phaze Concrete has become the leader in concrete construction are performance and teamwork.

The company believes if the team of workers are happy and skillful, they complete quality jobs.

""We don't want our staff to come to work and earn a paycheck and go home,"" says a company representative.

""We want them to learn transferable skills and have a valuable experience with a great business.""

Phaze Concrete offers their employees and families two different programs.

This program is one of over 37,000 various apprenticeship programs offered around the country.

Through these programs, the business dedicates themselves to ensuring proper training and skills become attained.

Employees have the option to learn transferable skills, but stay on the job and earn a living.

The apprenticeship program has been successful for the company.

In 2016, Phaze Concrete partnered with the Department of Labor's Department of Apprenticeships sector.

The partnership created an exciting and unique education work program.

This program was first of its kind in the area.

The value of this type of apprenticeship program became well-known by Alexander Acosta, United States Secretary of Labor.

The diplomat attended the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers Meeting in May of 2017, where he resounded the support of the plan.

Another great offering by Phaze and how confident they treat their employees is offering GED support.

Any worker who does not have their GED can take part in the education class and take the exam.

The company has been able to let workers continue to earn a paycheck and take courses at the same time.

This application is not only extended to every employee but also their families.

The program allows every family in Phaze to earn a better living and improve their way of life.

""Phaze Concrete gives the GED program that is available to all employees and family members of our workers,"" says the group's spokesperson.

The construction and concrete industries have become some of the more significant areas in the nation, offering employment to millions of Americans.

The industry continues to expand every year with more jobs and ways to advance in the sector.

Why should other companies copy Phaze Concrete's ways?

If they want to have happy employees who are excited to come to work, then they will offer these type of programs.

Phaze Concrete has been successful on the worksite by completing jobs early and under budget.

They have seen many workers advance their careers in the construction industry and beyond.

There is no question why Phaze Concrete has become the leader in the concrete building industry for the past decade."
71,Staff,2/9/2018 6:18,"duced"":""12%"",""sm_api_title"":""Manufacturers Coalition Builds Training Initiatives"",""sm_api_content"":"" By Jessica Borza, MVMC Executive DirectorYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - In 2017, the Ohio Manufacturers Association cited the Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition program as the best model to follow if manufacturers are to fill their need for skilled tradesmen.

Since its inception in 2011, The Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition has been at the forefront of addressing manufacturing workforce issues.

Last fall, we presented an endorsement system to ensure consistent quality and responsive curricula.

Programs that received our seal of approval consist of Eastern Gateway Community College's new machining technology associate degree program, Trumbull Career & Technical Center's adult machine trades program and machining programs at the career and technical centers in Mahoning and Columbiana counties.

The coalition is working with Youngstown State University, Eastern Gateway and other partners to advance the Mahoning Valley Innovation and Commercialization Center in downtown Youngstown.

When completed, this $30 million training center in the former misdemeanant jail will provide students with the equipment and instruction to acquire the skills local manufacturers need.

The coalition launched its industrial maintenance group apprenticeship program last fall.

Like the machining apprenticeship program the year before, the industrial maintenance apprenticeship program enables small- to mid-sized companies to plug into a training program and receive grant funding through the Greater Oh-Penn Apprenticeship Network to offset their costs.

This year, the coalition may add a group welding apprenticeship, and we are organizing a class of machining apprentices in partnership with the Columbiana County Career & Technical Center.

The coalition is transitioning to new leadership.

Founder Brian Benyo of Brilex Industries is now immediate past president with Dale Foerster of Starr Manufacturing succeeding him as president.

A priority this year is welcoming all manufacturers, regardless of size or sector, to join us in growing the pipeline of the next generation of manufacturing workers.

Specifically, MVMC will organize an affinity group of extruders to dive more deeply into their needs and tailor solutions.

MVMC will soon launch WorkAdvance 2.0 in which companies will identify talent who have the potential for upward mobility, then work with the coalition to tailor training and coaching of those employees.

The coalition will work with companies to enhance their recruitment efforts.

It's the need to meet the country's demand for 500,000 more skilled construction workers - a number that could double if the promise of a $1.5 trillion infrastructure proposal in Washington becomes a reality.

Our construction unemployment is at record lows and the scarcity of skilled workers will only get worse, thanks to the development of Foxconn, a project which could require more than 10,000 workers for five years.

February is Career and Technical Education Month, and it comes at the perfect time to celebrate the students, apprentices, teachers, technical colleges and industry partners who are helping to prepare the American workforce for careers in construction.

We've neglected CTE over the years and now we're beginning to pay for it, quite literally.

Here in Wisconsin, the Associated Builders and Contractors has more than 1,300 apprentices in 12 trades at ten technical colleges.

We are constantly advocating for the return of CTE in high schools to help prepare more students for high-paying careers in the trades.

The new Wisconsin Technical College System Completion Report for 2015-16 Apprenticeship Graduates shows the median annual salary for these new graduates is more than $71,600.

That's a number that is sure to attract more candidates to the skilled trades.

Policymakers at all levels of government should help by encouraging the expansion of the trades' workforce of the future.

In Wisconsin, there's a legislative initiative that could put a dent in the shortage of skilled construction workers by providing more access to apprenticeships.

It's Assembly Bill 508, commonly called the ""Apprenticeship Ratio Legislation."" Its basic goal is to allow more apprentices to enter the field by removing unnecessary restrictions.

Completing an apprenticeship takes between four and six years.

Construction employers cannot hire as many apprentices as they want or need to train because of current Department of Workforce Development rules that are equal parts prohibitive and convoluted.

If you want one painter apprentice, you need one skilled worker to oversee that person.

If you want to bring on four painting apprentices, you need 12 skilled workers to oversee them.

The Laborer Apprenticeship requires two skilled workers for every one apprentice until you get to ten apprentices, at which point it jumps to 22 skilled workers and then five more skilled workers for each additional apprentice thereafter.

It's imperative to get more recruits into training as quickly as possible.

Wisconsin is behind other states in this regard.

Iowa, Utah, North Dakota, Colorado and Nebraska have safely adopted one-to-one ratios.

The federal government routinely approves one-to-one ratios for its apprenticeship programs.

Michigan just passed a law that allows three electrical apprentices to serve under one skilled worker.

AB 508 has passed the Wisconsin Assembly and is waiting for action from the state Senate action so it can move to the governor's desk to be signed into law.

There is not one magic solution to ending the labor shortage in industries like construction, but AB 508 is a common-sense measure to expand CTE opportunities for anyone who wants to train for these high-paying careers.

76,MARY ANN KEARNS,2/9/2018 13:25,"duced"":""5%"",""sm_api_title"":""Apprenticeships offer opportunities for businesses and employees"",""sm_api_content"":"" Mike Nemes, deputy secretary of the Kentucky Labor Cabinet, and Steve Tressler, Apprenticeship Program coordinator, came to Maysville Friday to promote the program to local businesses.

The pair spoke before the Maysville Mason County Area Chamber of Commerce luncheon to explain how the Apprenticeship Program works and how area employers can become involved in the program.

""There is a need in Kentucky for skilled labor,"" Memes said.

The program is designed to train those much-needed workers, he said.

While apprenticeship programs are often aimed at jobs such as electricians or plumbers, the Kentucky program can range from those traditional jobs to those in technology or the aerospace industry, Memes said.

The program works with schools and employers to offer not only what is needed, but also what is wanted, Memes said.

""Tell us what you need. We'll do everything we can to accommodate you,"" he said.

Tressler explained the program and how it broadens the opportunities for Kentuckians to enter the work-force in high paid careers that do not require a college degree.

""The problem is, education only gets graded on how many people go to college,"" Tressler said.

""That can't be the only choice, there's got to be other options.""

Only six out of 10 high school graduates go to college, Tressler said.

Of those six, only three remain in college after two years and of those three only about half - 1.6 - will get a degree.

""That leaves eight people without a college degree and without skills,"" he said.

""That's where apprenticeships come in.""

Registered apprenticeships have two components - 144 hours of class time each year, equivalent to three, three-credit hour courses and 2,000 hours of on-the-job training.

The time frame can be stretched beyond a 12-month period and apprenticeships can range from one to six years, Tressler said.

There is financial help available and KEES money earned by high school students can be used in coordination with the program, Tressler said.

The program is not just available to graduating students but also to adults who may want to change careers or have been laid off from their job, Nemes said.

There are apprenticeships recognized in more than 1,200 different jobs, according to Tressler.

Once completed the apprenticeship training is recognized nationwide, he said.

Applying for a business to become part of the apprenticeship program is easy and requires little paperwork, Tressler said.

Who wouldn't, given a rare opportunity at school to work with NASA engineers on a project destined for space.

A new industry partnership designed to boost the country's manufacturing workforce allowed the 17-year-old to work for months on a special project, crafting custom handrails for astronauts living in microgravity aboard the International Space Station.

Industry experts say up to 2 million manufacturing jobs could go unfilled by 2025 because workers' skills don't meet their needs.

Who is now preparing for graduation, doesn't intend to be passed over for a good job.

""For me, machining and working with metal is really fun,"" said Lopez, who lives in Lawndale.

""It's something I love to do. It's just something that feels right to me. I put everything I had into this for months and months.""

He shouted with joy when he learned recently that the handrail parts he manufactured were accepted by NASA and will launch to the floating laboratory in low-Earth orbit.

This year, Hawthorne High and dozens of other schools affiliated with the nonprofit SME Education Foundation's program to train future manufacturing workers joined with the High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware program.

Besides making extremely precise hardware from blueprint designs, as Lopez did, high school students design prototypes for the space station, make special bags and slippers for astronauts, and even develop orbital menu items through NASA. ""These students are making parts as precise as NASA needs - they're quality-controlled and quality-checked,"" said Josh Cramer, an SME Education Foundation director.

""They go through credentialing programs and learn things like how to measure things beyond a thousandth of an inch.""

Lopez spent months agonizing over three-dimensional programming and precise measurements needed to construct the sturdy, 8.5-inch-long, sky-blue handrails.

They'll act as hooks for astronaut hands and feet as they navigate through their quarters.

""Alex has always been willing to go above and beyond. Now he has real-life experience and he got it in high school,"" said Lucas Pacheco, coordinator for Hawthorne High's engineering and manufacturing magnet.

""A lot of times we're making things just for us, but once you start making parts for other people where they have certain specifications, it becomes more challenging.""

Lopez and other students who worked on the project enjoyed the support of Pacheco and school staff, as well as from NASA and Northrop Grumman engineers.

""We 3D-printed the parts and then sat down with mentors to help the students visualize how to make these,"" Pacheco said.

""It completely changed the way that we teach because, now all of a sudden, we had a real project to start designing for. The kids were super excited when NASA told us that, if they can make the parts needed, they will fly them to the space station.""

The things they learned are immediately useful in the advanced manufacturing field, where industry experts say there's a big skills gap between what workers can do an what's required for jobs.

""There's a huge skills gap on the horizon that manufacturers feel every day,"" Cramer said.

""The gap is the mismatch between we're graduating out of college and what manufacturers in the industry are looking for. That's something we work on every day - building programs so we can shrink that gap.""

The need for well-trained, advanced-manufacturing workers is especially palpable in the South Bay, where SpaceX is rapidly advancing aerospace technologies.

The Boeing Co. builds satellites in El Segundo and Northrop Grumman Corp. is constructing the successor to the Hubble telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, in Redondo Beach.

A suite of supportive aerospace manufacturing businesses has flooded the region, and local politicians and business-development groups are accelerating programs to train workers in the skills needed by the companies.

South Bay Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi and Sen. Ben Allen have been holding regular meetings and informational sessions with industry partners to plan educational and training programs.

The South Bay Workforce Investment Board, which trains workers and helps connect businesses with job seekers, developed a unique training program with West Los Angeles College for aerospace engineers last year.

That Aero-Flex Pre-Apprenticeship Program works with newly hired engineers and machinists to provide training and education while they're working.

""We just got approval from the U.S. Department of Labor to register the first-degree apprenticeship program for aerospace engineers,"" said Chris Cagle, the workforce investment board's regional affairs manager.

""It's the first in the nation. Students can take classes their employer wants while they're working.""

Lopez said he hopes his new NASA-honed skills will help propel him into a job working with machines - and that a position at NASA, SpaceX or another aerospace company would be ideal.

The handrails he helped build will be launched on a SpaceX rocket, though they have not yet been scheduled for delivery.

""It's been like a dream come true,"" Lopez said.

""I love learning new things and, to me, this is one of my biggest achievements. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to make. I had to learn a completely new way of programming in 3D."".

""I think the biggest learning experience I had was that, no matter how hard something gets - because there were parts where it seemed impossible - if you have support from the right people, you can pretty much learn to do anything."""

""These kids, they've gone farther than some of their peers to get to where they've gotten to,"" said Kinney, chief claims officer at The Hartford.

""They've persevered through stuff that others have not, and I love that profile because you throw them into a training environment and they work hard, they're smart as hell and frankly, they're great at problem-solving.""

They also will help The Hartford sustain its pool of professionals in an industry facing a talent drain as aging workers retire.

That's the year by which The Hartford hopes to have hired 200 apprentices from its program, which launched in June with federal registration.

Stef Zielezienski, general counsel of the American Insurance Association, said The Hartford's effort to answer industry labor needs is a smart one.

""Chris Swift is one of just a handful of CEOs leading the industry's efforts to address our employment gaps,"" Zielezienski said of The Hartford's chairman and CEO. The 15 students in the inaugural program - nine at CCC, six at Rio Salado College in Tempe, Ariz. - combine insurance and other business-specific classes with paid, on-the-job, customer-facing training at claims centers in Windsor and Scottsdale, Ariz. Most were about a year into their college studies when they began the apprenticeship, meaning they'll complete their associate degrees by spring and their required on-the-job hours by September.

As long as apprentices continue the course they've set so far, they'll be offered full-time jobs this summer after they graduate, Kinney said.

While the benefits and pay are attractive, so too is the flexibility offered to students managing work and school, said apprentice Max Mejia, 29.

""That really got my attention because not that many jobs do that nowadays,"" Mejia, a CCC student on track to get his associate degree in accounting in the spring and apprentice credential in September, said of the work flexibility around things like school exams.

He intends to seek full-time employment at The Hartford, citing the positive environment and company's reputation.

Fellow apprentice Alexis Martin, 22, also plans to work full-time there after apprenticing and graduating with a management degree.

""Overall, it's a great career opportunity and I think that future apprentices could benefit from this as well,"" Martin said.

Adia Copper, 25, who's studying business management, said the apprenticeship is preparing her to hit the ground running at The Harford, where she intends to seek full-time work.

She also values the connections she's getting with longtime employees at The Hartford.

""I can definitely see myself working long term for the company.""

Capital Community College President Wilfredo Nieves said the college has begun recruiting students for the next apprenticeship, saying the program is working well as students earn while they learn.

Key for students, Nieves said: mentors interested in them and validating them.

""The good thing for The Hartford, they also get the opportunity to evaluate an individual who they've trained,"" Nieves said.

""I can't understate the value of loyalty that's developed between the student and the organization.""

The program includes 61 credit hours of college coursework and 2,400 hours of on-the-job training at The Hartford, with a curriculum that includes insurance-specific topics.

The program includes the Connecticut Department of Labor, Arizona Department of Economic Security and is registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, which provides tuition assistance through its American Apprenticeship Grant Initiative.

The Hartford's Kinney said CCC has done well to align curriculums with needed skill sets.

The Hartford isn't the only insurer CCC partners with - others include Travelers Cos.

In 2007, Travelers began a program in partnership with CCC now known as Capital's Career Advancement Program and is the model used for the Travelers EDGE program.

Travelers EDGE is a school-to-career pipeline to increase access to higher education for underrepresented students and highlight careers in insurance and financial services, the company said.

The Career Advancement Program feeds Travelers EDGE and supports other area employers.

Capital Community College students in the career advancement course must take business-related majors and a full-year internship at Travelers.

In addition to an internship, Travelers provides students with a financial stipend, mentors and professional development opportunities, the company said.

Once students graduate with an associate degree, those interested in pursuing a career at Travelers or in another related industry can continue with the Travelers EDGE program if they pursue a bachelor's degree at UConn or Central Connecticut State University.

Travelers then continues to provide financial assistance, mentors, internships, job-shadowing experiences and professional development workshops.

Many participants then apply for full-time positions at Travelers after graduation, the company said.

Since 2007, Travelers Edge has provided more than $23 million in financial support to schools and community organizations, provided 443 undergraduate students with a scholarship or stipend, placed 206 students in Travelers internships and helped 62 land full-time jobs at Travelers, the company reported.

Travelers EDGE graduates work in departments that include actuarial, claim, underwriting and operations to IT, finance, legal and marketing.

The Guardian Life Insurance of America created a personal finance center for students at CCC that includes a tech lab for financial coaching, workshops on budgeting, best practices in paying for college, credit and debt management, retirement and investment planning and free tax-filing assistance.

Guardian also covers fees, books and materials for students enrolled in the Money Management for Life course focusing on personal finance and offering full-time paid internships for students who complete the course.

At The Hartford, building a self-sustaining pipeline of diverse talent was also among the apprenticeship program's goals, Kinney said.

As the apprentices become full-time employees, they also qualify for tuition reimbursement to get four-year and graduate degrees, if they wish, further benefiting the company over time, he said.

Apprentice Mejia said it's been rewarding helping customers.

To train and place military service members and veterans into tech positions.

The apprenticeship program was created by the Washington Technology Industry Association in 2016 and started as a pilot program in Seattle.

To recruit, train and place diverse talent into tech roles.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are more than 100,000 veterans in In 2016, a survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that 44 percent of veterans left their first post-military job within a year, with difficulty transitioning into the role being a key factor.

""When service members leave the armed forces, there isn't always a clear pathway into tech - even though they possess many of the same skills they need to excel in the industry,"" said Jennifer Carlson.

""The problem is, tech employers oftentimes overlook their exceptional talent. Through Apprenti, we're providing them with a path into a tech career, and we're proud to launch our program in Hawai'i.""

Once accepted into the program - which starts in April - apprentices receive between 14-20 weeks of certified technical training provided by PCATT at Honolulu Community College.

Followed by one year of full-time, paid, on-the-job training in Amazon AWS data centers in the continental United States.

They will be trained in various job roles, including computer hardware repair and troubleshooting; networking configuration and administration; Linux administration; and server installation and maintenance.

""This program is a win-win, and we are committed to providing best-in-class employer-driven training and workforce development for our veterans and service members. As technology develops at an accelerated pace, we are seeing exponential growth in the need for talent in tech. We are excited to work with Amazon and Apprenti to help our veterans and service members get the training they need to succeed in the tech industry,"" said Steven Auerbach.

The technical training is entirely funded by the Hawai'i Department of Labor and Industrial Relations through its $2.9 million.

Apprenti provides screening and selection support, administrative management and program oversight.

As a hybrid competency and time-based program, those with a strong determination to complete the rigorous training are encouraged to apply.

Active military members separating from service and veterans in Hawai'i should apply at ApprentiCareers.org by March 2.

Those interested must be willing to work in another state.

Montana Governor Steve Bullock recently visited West Paw's manufacturing facility in Bozeman, Mont., to recognize the company's apprenticeship program aimed at training workers to meet the demands of the growing business.

This injection molding training program is Montana's first registered apprenticeship in the manufacturing industry.

""Innovation certainly runs through our veins here in Montana, whether its harnessing new technologies or manufacturing outdoor gear, tasty microbrews and world-class toys for our four-legged friends,"" said Governor Bullock.

""Businesses are able to nurture these big ideas through on-the-job training and apprentices are able to earn a living wage while developing the skills and knowledge to take on the jobs of the future.""

West Paw worked with the Montana Registered Apprenticeship unit through the Montana Department of Labor & Industry to create a highly customized program.

The program is a nontraditional hybrid program that includes both competency and time-based components that will allow workers to move through the program quickly as West Paw looks to skill up workers more efficiently.

The program includes a high level of safety and technical education training.

""West Paw is incredibly excited to participate in Montana's new apprenticeship program. Our unique perspective is that a diverse economy makes for strong communities,"" said Spencer Williams, CEO and president of West Paw.

""By creating manufacturing apprenticeships, we not only have the opportunity to educate but also to demonstrate the diversified work environment that manufacturing provides. Montana's Apprenticeship Program will help us attract, train and retain great employees. It is a win for all.""

West Paw attended a presentation on apprenticeships at Governor Bullock's Innovate Montana Symposium last summer and has since worked with Montana Registered Apprenticeship unit to create a set of standards for the injection molding apprenticeship.

Montana leads the nation in manufacturing GDP growth.

Overall, manufacturing in Montana added $3.2 billion to the state's GDP in 2016, over $1.2 billion more than the industry's 2011 contribution.

Since 2000, more than 1,000 business sponsors across the state have implemented training programs through the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program.

Almost 90 percent of apprentices stay in Montana after completing their programs and registered apprentices who successfully completed their training have an average wage nearly $20,000 higher than the statewide average wage.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff challenged the nation to create 5 million apprenticeships in just five years, a concept receiving bipartisan support and endorsement from the White House, to strengthen the nation's workforce.

It is a lofty goal, given that data showed approximately 500,000 apprentices in 2016, but it is a crucial strategy needed to close the ""Skills gaps,"" which threaten to limit the expansion of the U.S. economy; to address the millions of individuals who are unemployed or underemployed; to mitigate stagnant wages held back by flat levels of productivity; and to fight mounting levels of student debt.

Given this ""Moonshot mandate,"" partnerships will be ever more important in hitting the mark.

The Advance Michigan Center for Apprenticeship Innovation, led by the Southeast Michigan Community Alliance and Workforce Intelligence Network, has brought together community colleges, local and regional companies, and workforce/economic development partners to greatly expand registered apprenticeships across 13 counties in Southeast Michigan.

Collaboratively among reputable partners, AMCAI is setting standards to support employers to launch and sustain registered apprenticeships.

The registration and implementation processes, perceived as onerous by many business owners, has been streamlined by AMCAI to help eliminate a significant barrier to launch and create win-win opportunities for employers and potential apprentices.

Developing a DOL registered apprenticeship is important, as the formalized process sets a high expectation for the employer, educational providers, and apprentices.

Further, the process helps ensure quality standards are set for apprentices to receive mentorship, classroom instruction, and hands-on experience to make a positive impact in boosting productivity in the workforce.

Registered apprenticeships provide employers with scalability, consistent data on performance, and return on investment.

For apprentices, in addition to a full-time job with an increasing wage and no student loan debt, individuals gain a nationally-recognized DOL credential, transferable skills, and opportunities to advance once their apprenticeship is complete.

This level of detail demanded in registered apprenticeship becomes especially significant as various partners work collaboratively to dispel the misconception that many school counselors, parents, and potential apprentices have toward the standard perception of an apprenticeship model that rewarding occupations are only available through a bachelor's degree career pathway, or that apprenticeable positions are confined to labor-intensive occupations.

Apprenticeship has gone from high skills to high skills and high tech, and continues to grow in ""Non-traditional"" industries, such as information technology and health care, leading to high-paying careers that do not require a traditional four-year college degree.

Employers have misconceptions about apprenticeship as well, and have expressed concern that their level of investment in developing workplace talent will not be reciprocated, or that the implementation costs will be too significant.

Apprenticeship is a proven, cost-saving option for employers to grow their own talent, and for workers to gain in-demand skills needed for the jobs of the future.

For every dollar spent on an apprenticeship, employers receive an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity, though some industries - such as millwrights or sheet metal workers - see even greater returns, up to $5 for every dollar spent.

More data showing similar ROI for employers and wage progression for apprentices for a growing list of different occupations can be found using the apprenticeship ROI calculator on the AMCAI website.

There is work to do in getting businesses and individuals excited about how apprenticeship can help resolve the skills gap.

Through thoughtful collaboration among stakeholders in Michigan's economy and workforce, we can improve our capabilities to significantly train and increase Michigan's skilled and trained workforce across all industries as a region, a state and a nation.

Kentucky Labor Cabinet Deputy Secretary Mike Nemes traveled with several state officials to Prestonsburg on Feb. 13 to announce the registration of the new apprenticeship in partnership with officials from the Prestonsburg City Utilities Commission and Big Sandy Community & Technical College.

""I think this is the first one after your success, it will just go on throughout the state,"" Nemes told Prestonsburg officials.

Prestonsburg Utilities, which serves thousands of customers in the city and in neighboring counties and communities, has 18 certified operators for its Class IV water plant.

This apprenticeship will help it find new operators and it will shorten the time it takes for them to earn certification, officials said.

Prestonsburg Mayor Les Stapleton said city officials have been working with the college and state agencies for two years to establish the apprenticeship.

He said the need for the program arose during a Rural Water Association meeting in which an official pointed out that most water treatment operators in attendance were older.

""We've actually got a situation now where we can have people that are getting trained and getting their certifications quicker so they can go right into the workforce,"" he said, later pointing out that ""The fact that city utilities has taken it upon themselves to be a leader in it is awesome.""

Prestonsburg City Utilities Superintendent and CEO Turner E. Campbell said the commission has considered establishing a training program for years.

He said it will be a ""Tremendous plus"" for the agency.

""We were on board from day one,"" he said, ""For the reason that our workforce is aging. We're thinking down the road, that, hey, we better be getting some people coming through who are learning how to be treatment operators. For us, we were all for it. We were ready on day one.""

""Dr. Sherry Zilka, president of BSCTC, said the program is a""win-win"" for the college, the utilities commission and the community.

"" It's one of several workforce program the college offers.

""It's important to develop a workforce that can stay here and earn a livable wage and not have to move away,"" she said.

""By offering this locally, we can have people that can upgrade their skills or feed into the pipeline and not have to leave. We're hearing that the jobs are going to be needed, so in order to do that, we wanted to step up to the plate and meet the demands of the workforce to help fill that need.""

Tracy Osborne-Clay, program coordinator for the Kentucky Department of Workplace Standard's apprenticeship division, said the ""Earn while you learn"" program will be a ""Wonderful pipeline for the youth and for the community.""

""We're hoping to keep people in the area and to grow the area,"" she said.

Donald Compton, manager of the city's water and wastewater treatment plants, and employee Tim Goble, a Class IV operator at Prestonsburg Utilities, agreed that the program will shorten amount of time it takes people to become certified operators.

They both earned certification with on-the-job training.

""It's a stable job and it's not going out of business,"" Goble said.

""Everybody is going to need drinking water and it's always going to increase, especially in this area.""

Kentucky has had apprenticeship programs for decades, but Nemes and Kentucky Labor Cabinet Secretary Derrick Ramsey started pushing to expand apprenticeships in recent years to increase the number of skilled workers available in the state.

Apprenticeships are available in numerous types of industries and the agency also launched a Justice to Journeyman program to train inmates as well as another program to help foster children get the skills they need to get a job.

""It's exciting,"" Nemes said, talking about how apprenticeships are improving the state's workforce.

BSCTC officials said the college hopes to expand the water and wastewater treatment operator program to other counties in the future."
112,roy.maurer@shrm.org,2/16/2018 0:00,"duced"":""16%"",""sm_api_title"":""Could Swiss-Style Apprenticeships Fill in the U.S. Skills Gap?"",""sm_api_content"":"" As U.S. employers create more jobs with in-demand skills, businesses, workforce development advocates, educational institutions and the government are turning to apprenticeships to bring workers up to speed.

President Donald Trump has proposed increasing the number of apprentices from 500,000 to 5 million by 2022, doubling spending on the Apprenticeship USA program, and simplifying the registration process to make it easier for organizations to hire apprentices.

He's described it as his Labor Department's top priority.

The Trump administration has partnered with Switzerland to learn about its apprenticeship system-one of the most robust and successful in the world.

Roughly 70 percent of Swiss nationals begin their career with an apprenticeship, keeping youth unemployment down and talent pools for many occupations well-stocked.

The Ambassador of Switzerland to the United States Martin Dahinden discussed with SHRM Online the mechanics of the Swiss model that make it work, if the model can be replicated in the U.S., and what role employers should play in the process.

Dahinden: First, training takes place partly in a classroom setting, and in parallel at work, bringing both theory and practice together.

Practice is very important to be gained in a workplace setting, because there you are exposed to cutting-edge technology, interaction with customers, and being part of a team with people from different generations and professions.

Secondly, by defining the curriculum, companies are involved from the start.

Government plays an important role, but the private sector is involved, and this makes sure that the experience somebody acquires during an apprenticeship fits well with the labor market.

It's also important that the apprentices do not pay for their education.

An apprentice has a small salary that increases during the time spent working, but he or she can acquire an education without paying for it.

The system in Switzerland is open, meaning that apprentices are open to go to a technical college or university once fulfilling the apprenticeship requirements.

It's not a crossroads where you have to decide to either get an apprenticeship or go to college.

Apprenticeships are available not only in manufacturing, but also in IT, health care, and professional business services like finance, insurance or marketing.

Apprenticeships in Switzerland are not considered a second-class education.

People who started with apprenticeships have become government ministers or CEOs of multinational companies.

Dahinden: The United States and Switzerland have a very different educational environment.

I think that you can't easily replicate the Swiss model in the U.S. The best thing to do is to look at the core elements and then to think how to combine the practical training in a company with classroom training that provides a broader perspective.

This can be done in cooperation with community colleges and workforce development organizations.

The right input from the private sector is needed to ensure that the skills acquired during apprenticeships are the skills needed in the labor market.

The U.S. can learn from the Swiss experience about what works or doesn't work, but every country interested in an apprenticeship model needs to develop their own.

Dahinden: I've seen the ones that have involved Swiss companies.

There have been companies that couldn't find the people they were looking for, and were not able to bring in expatriate workers, so they developed their own program.

It's a company initiative in which they have taken curricula elements from Switzerland and created their own program.

A group of companies formed a consortium and worked with a local community college to train a critical mass of apprentices that benefits them all.

A third type is a more systemic approach inspired by the Swiss system, like we've seen in Colorado, where CareerWise Colorado works with the state government to create programs statewide.

Dahinden: In Switzerland employers are not obligated to maintain apprenticeship programs.

They want to do it, which leads to having a commitment to it.

They are not doing it because it's compulsory or to receive tax incentives.

There is also no commitment from the company to employ the apprentices after the initial contract has run out.

They also provide a workplace, of course, pay apprentices and play a cooperative role in designing curriculum.

Dahinden: In my view, it's not just new branding or packaging that is needed.

It's not just to say that everything is in place and you just need good marketing.

The challenge is to determine if a system can be erected that closes skills gaps, creates jobs and has a positive impact on unemployment.

The Governor's Office of Workforce Innovation - created by executive order in 2016 to manage and bolster training programs - said last July that it aims to boost the number of apprenticeship programs in the state by 10 percent within the next five years.

At the time, Nevada offered 78 state apprenticeship programs.

Workforce Connections, Southern Nevada's local workforce development board, has launched a workforce development specialist apprenticeship program to prepare individuals interested in workforce development careers.

The new program has two sponsors: Truckee Meadows Community College and Workforce Connections.

Manny Lamarre, executive director of the workforce innovation office, said the program will offer more than 600 apprenticeship opportunities across the manufacturing, health care and workforce development sectors.

Truckee Meadows Community College will work with Panasonic, Renown Health and others to train industrial maintenance mechanics, machine operators, production operators and certified nursing assistants.

Apprenticeships provide structured on-the-job training and mentoring while compensating apprentices under a merit-based, earn-as-you-learn wage system.

""It's a way to really upgrade our workforce and provide them the appropriate skills, education and credentials to be successful, particularly as we think about reducing the skills gap,"" Lamarre previously told the Review-Journal.

Nevada is 200,000 jobs short of the national average in five of the state's emerging target industries - aerospace and defense, natural resources, business information technology ecosystems, health and medical services and manufacturing and logistics.

""The first piece is to have new programs. The second piece is to have an increased number of apprentices, and the third piece is increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities at the apprentice level,"" Lamarre said.

Panasonic has committed to hiring 500 new apprentices.

""As we work to build on our state's economic successes, we have to create opportunities for Nevadans to acquire the skills needed to be effective in the labor market,"" Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement.

""I am proud of the dedicated work of the State Apprenticeship Council members and OWINN as they create a bridge between our students and the apprenticeship opportunities that will help Nevadans to meet the needs of employers statewide."""

125,John  Bailey,2/17/2018 0:00,"duced"":""28%"",""sm_api_title"":""New approaches help revive century-old idea of soft skills training"",""sm_api_content"":"" There's more to it than this obviously, but it's where employers expect their employees to start when they are hired - along with having a positive attitude.

A hundred years ago, the leaders of industry in the United States stumbled onto these ideas when they were asking themselves what could they do to develop even more productive and more involved employees at their companies.

An extensive study of engineering education by Charles Mann for the Carnegie Foundation came up with the idea of investing in more time to teach something called soft skills.

""These interviews, together with a study of the methods of rating college graduates in several large manufacturing companies, indicated that personal qualities such as common sense, integrity, resourcefulness, initiative, tact, thoroughness, accuracy, efficiency and understanding of men are universally recognized as being no less necessary to a professional engineer than are technical knowledge and skill,"" the study said.

Luke Walling, president of Temprano Techvestors, a business-to-business software products company based in Newton, said any applicant they consider for a job needs to have good communication skills to start.

""Much of our work involves demonstrating, implementing, supporting and selling complicated cyber security and general information technology tools,"" Walling said in an HDR email.

He's been impressed with some of the programs, public and private, K-12 education has begun using, like Leader in Me, to develop these traits in potential employees.

""Students are empowered to learn in new and different ways more like that of a college environment, but held to rigorous standards of accountability in return for this freedom,"" Walling said.

Walling is hoping K-64 can be a pathway to develop a more ""Home grown, sustainable"" leadership training program for all the county's school systems.

The objective of K-64 is to engage more students and employers in local educational programs that help shape future careers and meet workforce demands, according to k-64learning.com.

Its priorities include: one-to-world classroom technology, developing tech savvy educators, work-based learning, employer engagement, career adaptability and character education.

""Can we do it? I believe so. I've seen an unexpected amount of interest in the program and am optimistic today in its future,"" Walling said.

This was an issue Catawba County Economic Development Corporation President Scott Millar remembers Glenn Barger, a former Catawba County Schools superintendent and county commissioner, brought up for discussion in 2011.

Today, Millar sees programs like K-64 as an example of how different groups in the county are prioritizing the importance of soft skills training again.

""The employers can train people to do the work they need if they show up and if they're on time,"" Millar said.

""The real issue behind the soft skills development is will people show up, will they be there with a great attitude, will they understand that they are part of a process.""

Nathan Huret, Catawba County Economic Development Corporation Director of Existing Industry, agreed the underlying theme of soft skills and character development always seems to be part of any discussion on workforce development.

""At the end of the day, what I often hear from employers is they want someone who's going to be dependable and have a willingness to learn,"" Huret said.

Huret said his wife is a teacher, so he has heard of character development in the schools for years, but showing how it applies to getting a job in the ""Real world"" is different now.

The bottom line is being able to convince existing and potential employers the county has a workforce ready to do a job and is trainable.

Millar agreed programs like K-64, Leader in Me, Apprenticeship Catawba, give his office a very effective tool when they're talking to potential new businesses for the county.

Showing there is a system in place to address the need of soft skills training can be the difference between counties competing for the same business.

""What's more expensive than an employee,"" Millar said.

Like Waller, Bill McBrayer of Lexington Home Brands weighs soft skills as nearly as important as having the work skills needed for a job.

""I've heard stories a number of times of applicants who may have the technical skills to interview well and actually get the job but then three months later they're terminated because the soft skill component of their resume was missing,"" McBrayer said.

He said there are three things employers in any industry are looking for in potential employees: be at work on time every day, do the job you're asked to do and get along with the people in your department.

Because of this, he has seen the education piece to this issue become even more important in recent years.

McBrayer is a member of the North Carolina State Board of Community Colleges.

The North Carolina Board of Community Colleges recently created the Employability Skills Alignment Project to address these needs.

This project is being considered because when interviewed during the NCWorks 1,000 in 100, employers cited the lack of employability skills as the second-highest reason they experienced difficulty filling jobs, according to the NC Community College's proposal.

The results of the last five academic alignment projects indicated that employers emphasized the importance of soft skills, stressing the need for aligning the skills to meet state, national and global standards.

Catawba Valley Community College has addressed this on a local level as well with its revamped Work Based Learning class, now a requirement for all students enrolled in the college's school of business, business and industry.

Gary Muller, CVCC Dean for the School of Business, Industry and Technology, said this new direction started with CVCC President Garrett Hinshaw.

""They come out with great skills but they're really struggling first to get an interview and then to do well in the interview.""

The original course covered some of the basics for new job seekers: making a resume, learning interviewing skills, but it needed more depth, Muller said.

This new course will be taught by Tammy Muller, who's excited about some of the changes the college made and what it could mean for students.

""They may get a job, but they may not get the job that they have worked hard for because they may not get the opportunities to interview with these companies who would really value their technical skills because they're lacking the soft skills to get those interviews,"" Tammy Muller said.

The SkillsUSA program at CVCC is another example of ways the college tries to help sharpen soft skills for students.

SkillsUSA is a national partnership of students, teachers and industry representatives working together to ensure America has a skilled workforce, according to skillsusa.org.

The state of North Carolina now requires all school districts to provide some type of character development training as well."

""I am a welder and hoping to find a job in the pipeline industry,"" said Cameron Woolum, 19, of Delbarton, West Virginia.

Over four hours, people filed through the hallways of tables with several vendors, including building trade unions, construction companies, workforce agencies and community organizations.

Nicholas Embrey, 20, of Charleston, said he attends BridgeValley Community & Technical College but wanted to get his resume to as many potential employers as possible.

""I am in the electrical engineering program and want to get my foot in the door with an employer before I graduate,"" he said.

The Construction Trades Job Fair was a rare opportunity for job-seekers to connect with all the groups involved in the workforce development push in one place.

Brandon Williams, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 132 Training, said between the jobs available in the oil and natural gas industries in West Virginia, along with thousands of highway jobs from the West Virginia Roads to Prosperity plan, opportunities in the construction trades and industry have never been better.

""We believe it is important to be part of a job fair like this that provides people with the information they need to apply and be accepted into our apprenticeship training program,"" Williams said.

Gov. Jim Justice has said his roads plan is about thousands of jobs and he would like them to be filled by West Virginians first.

""We want to be able to supply the skilled workers needed to fill many of these jobs that are available,"" Williams said.

Apprenticeships, particularly in the construction industry, are increasingly seen by workforce officials as a way to connect job-seekers to a stable career, according to Steve White, director of the Affiliated Construction Trades of West Virginia.

""Apprentices, if their application is accepted by the union, work on projects alongside other employees and earn pay and benefits during a training period of three to five years,"" he said.

White said apprenticeship programs are ramping up on many levels due to factors like the passage of the road bond and growth of the oil and natural gas industries in the state.

""When it comes to training, apprenticeship programs are a successful, high-quality method that produces highly skilled and highly productive workers,"" he said.

""We anticipate millions of dollars of work and millions of dollars in paychecks, so we want to get the information out there to West Virginians so they can fill these jobs that are available and that are coming soon.""

""I am extremely interested in an apprenticeship,"" Woolum said.

""Anything to get my foot in the door to a permanent career job is an opportunity I would consider.""

It was evident the turnout exceeded expectations, as the space, at times, was crammed with people filing down a long hallway of vendors.

The job fair allowed for one-on-one meetings with construction employer representatives like Amy Childress with Swope Construction.

""Swope Construction is a general contractor company with offices in Bluefield and Huntington, West Virginia, with current projects going on in and around Huntington, southern West Virginia, southwest Virginia and parts of Kentucky,"" Childress said.

""We have had many people submit applications today, and we hope to be able to hire some of them very soon.""

Also at the job fair were officials with the West Virginia Department of Transportation that said the agency will be hiring up to 500 people in all categories, including engineers, accountants, environmentalists and highway workers due to the passage of the road bond referendum."

In December, the state's unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest ever recorded in Mississippi, and job growth reached a historic high.

The United States currently faces a ""Skills gap,"" which means employers in fields such as manufacturing and telecommunications cannot find workers with the qualifications to fill vacant positions.

Those positions stay empty, and bright, talented job seekers remain out of work.

One report from 2017 found that 45 percent of small businesses were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings.

More: What is the top need of Mississippi businesses?

More: Jobs available but skilled labor in short supply.

Monday, we will convene a roundtable discussion at Jackson State University with a specific focus on closing the skills gap.

We have brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including educators and local business leaders, to discuss ways that public and private sectors can be engaged in this process.

Above all, we believe in expanding job opportunities for all Americans to participate in the new economy.

There is no reason why our country's workforce cannot take on the jobs of tomorrow.

One way to do this is through apprenticeships and other workforce development programs.

Apprenticeships provide a unique opportunity for workers to ""Earn as they learn,"" combining education with on-the-job training.

Apprenticeships can lead to good-paying jobs while also meeting employers' growing demands for specific skill sets or credentials.

A Department of Labor study found that over 90 percent of apprentices find employment after completing their programs and earn an average starting salary of $60,000 per year.

These are programs that work, helping to build lasting careers.

Our roundtable will build on the good work that has been done so far in Mississippi to prepare workers for 21st-century jobs.

The Mississippi Apprenticeship Program has been focused on developing new registered apprenticeship programs.

Last November, the program registered its first three participants: Hinds Community College, Empire Truck Sales, and Stribling Equipment.

These programs are not only training a skilled workforce but offering opportunities for young workers to stay in our state, where they can find work in their hometowns and near their families.

We can do our part in Washington to expand the reach of workforce development efforts.

In June 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to develop policies that promote apprenticeships and workforce development programs.

His executive action also seeks to make existing programs more efficient.

Although the federal government has a role to play in facilitating these programs, it is not always as nimble as it could be.

The ""Apprenticeship Enhancement Act,"" introduced by U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, would help streamline the application and approval process.

By removing layers of government bureaucracy, the bill would make it easier for companies to register new apprenticeship programs or update existing programs.

The Federal Communications Commission is also taking steps to encourage job creation with the promotion of broadband deployment.

There are jobs to be found in the manufacturing and deployment of broadband infrastructure as well as in the businesses that use these connections to reach customers around the world.

Simply put, broadband can harness the talents of all Americans, create good-paying jobs, and help drive our nation's economic growth.

The FCC has wisely begun streamlining the processes governing wireless infrastructure deployment, which means that more Mississippians will have access to broadband and the economic opportunities it provides.

Our workers are the lifeblood of our economy, and we want them to succeed.

That success begins by giving Americans a fair shot at developing the skills necessary to participate in this economic resurgence.

Expanding apprenticeship programs and broadband deployment are key to doing just that.

""It's an issue for anyone in the tree industry,"" says Arthur Batson Jr., president of Lucas Tree Experts, which is based in Maine and has roughly 550 employees working throughout the U.S. and Canada providing tree services for utility, residential and commercial customers.

He says the labor force in tree work ""Comes and goes."" ""We're seeing a scarcity now that five or six years ago we didn't,"" says Batson, attributing that mainly to the change in the overall economy.

As far as attracting quality employees, Lucas Tree Service's main strategy is to identify every forestry-related program in the areas that the company operates, whether it's run by a high school, community college or university.

""We reach out to those programs and try to integrate ourselves by volunteering, offering our operation personnel to work with those programs, so we're more closely related to them. We know the number of students who are coming into them and going out of them. And in certain places, we've set up scholarships and internships to qualified students,"" explains Batson.

It requires a concerted and ongoing effort to form a relationship with the school and the students in that forestry-related program.

""You really have to get to know who the professor is, or the teachers. And we've donated equipment that they can use in their teaching and trainings, whether it be chainsaws or a used chipper - things that will be useful tools for them and their programs,"" he explains.

""And we offer our expertise. Maybe it's for a chainsaw safety training or aerial rescue, to try to assist with and become a part of their programs.""

Look for other opportunities as well, including working with programs for military veterans who are looking for civilian employment.

Apprenticing in arboriculture A new tactic that some companies are taking to ensure steady access to trained employees is to actively play a role in that training process by formally taking part in an apprenticeship program.

The first program was created several years ago in Wisconsin, when a collection of tree care companies from the Wisconsin Arborists Association, as well as industry organization TCIA, worked with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to form an Arborist Apprenticeship Program.

One of the companies involved, Wachtel Tree Science, became the first to officially enroll two of its employees in the program in June 2016.

""It's a state program. And the state was looking for viable careers for people,"" explains Dave Scharfenberger, president of Wachtel.

The challenge, he says, was to get state buy-in by showing that tree care offers a variety of viable career options, especially for those who might want to work outside.

""When we showed the state the number of people in Wisconsin who are working in tree care, some of the average wages, the fact that there are both city and private employees in this profession, they began to realize that this is an industry that wasn't on their radar screens the way others were."" It's pretty common in every state to be able to get an apprenticeship to become an electrician or a plumber, he points out, ""And it's the tree care industry's goal to get arborists there also.""

The program runs for 42 months and provides apprentices with a blend of on-the-job work experience and specially designed class work at an area technical college.

While it took hard work and a group effort to get the apprenticeship program established, now, from the perspective of an individual company, ""There's not a lot that you have to do,"" says Scharfenberger.

""There's a little bit of time to understand your commitment as a company, you both sign contracts of commitment to each other."" Wachtel Tree Science, for example, pays for the classes, and also pays its employees in the program for a certain number of hours per semester when they take classes.

The goal is to train these employees to be ready to make a career in tree care.

The company bears the financial investment in getting the apprentices trained, while the employee commits to completing the program and working hard along the way.

There is no commitment in terms of a time frame that they must work for the sponsoring company after completing the program.

""But history shows, when you look at apprenticeship programs in general across the country, is that these programs help graduate trained people that do tend to be very loyal to the company that put them through, as long as the company is decent with them."" While there is not yet a long track record for tree care apprentices, he notes that the retention rate for apprenticeship programs in general is very high.

""TCIA has been instrumental behind the scenes in getting other states to adopt it, and getting the federal government to accept what Wisconsin has done, so that it becomes more of a common thing to have an apprenticeship program,"" says Scharfenberger.

Group solutions Because the scarcity of skilled labor is a challenge faced by almost every tree care company, some believe that it will take an orchestrated, collective, industry-wide effort to really address it.

One example of tree care companies coming together to do just that is taking place in Atlanta.

There, a handful of companies joined forces to form the Greater Atlanta Tree Care Sector Partnership with a mission of creating a training program that would attract employees into and get them ready for careers in tree care.

Jamie Blackburn, vice president and chief operating officer of Arborguard Tree Specialists, one of the companies involved in the effort, credits the leadership of Brigitte Orrick, TCIA's director of workforce development, with helping to get the program off the ground in the face of several challenges.

Orrick called together an initial meeting of eight reputable tree care companies in the Atlanta metro area about two years ago, says Blackburn.

""She explained the issues that go along with launching any type of training program. I think that some companies had this impression that there was this magic wand that somehow could be waved and all of a sudden we'd have this degree program with a great instructor that would be turning out 50 workers a semester. And that's a little bit utopian,"" he states.

Instead, the group was faced with the reality that there was little tax money in the state of Georgia to fund a program through the technical college system.

""It's just hard to convince them to launch new programs,"" says Blackburn.

In the tree care industry also included lower-paying jobs in utilities and logging.

""They need to be able to convince parents that their kids are going to be coming out of the program making a livable wage,"" summarizes Blackburn.

TCIA's Orrick and some of the Atlanta tree care companies pressed ahead looking for solutions.

What resulted of all these discussions was the Arborist Workforce Training program, funded by local grands and run at a nearby Greening Youth Foundation facility.

That six-week program includes training from North American Training Solutions instructor Warren Williams and covers everything from OSHA and industry safety standards to basic arboriculture operations based on TCIA's Tree Care Academy Modules.

Participating tree care companies offer their expertise occasionally and agree to interview each of the program participants once they earn their certificates.

Two groups of 20 students have now come through the program; Blackburn says that Arborguard hired two of those students and 18 of the 20 have been placed with a participating tree care company.

When applicants to a program are screened for these skills, and then the skills are developed, those who complete the program are much more ready to be productive employees, he points out.

He says, as was proven in Atlanta, when tree care companies work together, there are many different approaches that can be taken to help draw in and train the next generation of tree care industry employees."

The training course, also known as WFAP, dates back to 1989 and is traditionally held in Sacramento, California.

WFAP has trained more than 2,000 apprentices in wildland firefighting and prepared them for a future as fire managers.

Wildland firefighters are dispatched to fight wildfires in national forests throughout the nation, including Alabama's four national forests-Bankhead, Conecuh, Talladega and Tuskegee.

In early February, 48 wildland firefighter apprentices gathered for the first WFAP academy at Auburn's Dixon Center.

They attended classes about fire behavior, fire suppression tactics, weather, safety, leadership, risk management and incident command all taught by seasoned fire experts.

Firefighter apprentices also gained hands-on field experience with situational awareness and tactical decision making, while practicing safety and teamwork skills.

""The Wildland Firefighter Apprenticeship Program develops our future fire and aviation managers in an innovative and unique educational experience, combining classroom and field based hands-on education at the Dixon Center,"" said Heath Cota, director of WFAP. Participating agencies include the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The Dixon Center's 5,300-plus acres features fresh water springs, longleaf pine forests, cypress swamps, frontage along the Conecuh River and the national forest.

Many do not know the craftsmanship involved in each project.

Phaze Concrete is the leader of concrete construction work in the western portion of the country.

It's the way they are treating employees that has people glowing about the company.

While the company has grown over the past decade, their goals remain the same.

Those goals are to complete projects on time and sometimes under budget.

For employees to advance their careers and earn a proper education.

Assisting employees to learn new skills they can carry onto the job site, the company has teamed with the Department of Apprenticeships.

The subdivision of the United States of Labor works with companies and apprentices.

Phaze Concrete has become dedicated to advance their workers to higher levels of concrete construction compliance.

The apprentices of Phaze Concrete learn directly on the job with fellow team members that have been with the company for years.

They learn the skills of the trade that they can use for the rest of their time in the industry.

These apprenticeship programs come highly recommended and recognized by the United States government.

The White House of American Innovation supports the effort and supporter of these type of programs.

The office boasted the efforts of the program at the G-20 Summit in of May 2017.

The positive effects of the program were presented on a national scale, furthering the importance of these exercises.

""We never want our workers simply to come to the job site and earn a paycheck and go home,"" says a company spokesperson.

""We want them to come and have a valuable experience, learning new skills they can carry with them on the job and further down the road in their career.""

While these workers learn better skills on the job site, they are helping Phaze Concrete grow and continue the tradition of quality work.

""Registered apprentices in the program, regardless of their age, will have the opportunity to complete training on the job,"" says the company spokesperson.

Another great offering by Phaze Concrete to their employees is their GED Program.

While many workers in the concrete construction industry lack proper education, Phaze wants to change that.

""Every employee can earn their GED while continuing to work,"" says the company spokesperson for Phaze Concrete.

""If they do not have their diploma or high school diploma equivalent, they can take the test while working.""

Phaze Concrete provides the GED readiness course that is available to all employees, but also their families.

""When an employee commits to the apprenticeship program or GED course, we commit to give them the most well-rounded concrete construction industry training available,"" adds the company spokesperson.

The treatment of their employees has led to a happy workplace and excellence in the work.

This excellence includes gaining high-end jobs with major companies.

Phaze Concrete was chosen to complete the concrete pouring on the Family Dollar distribution center.

This massive project measured over one million square feet.

Not only did it put Phaze Concrete on the national level with a big company, it earned awards.

The project earned Phaze Concrete the ACI Intermountain Chapter Award of Excellence for the flatwork and tilt-up concrete project.

Today, Phaze Concrete has over 250 team members who are able to work on projects all over the western portion of the United States.

The excellence continues in the work these educated workers complete and will only grow stronger as the programs continue."

Byrd Institute to host a free, one-day public forum on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, on the Apprenticeship Works Program to promote the expansion of advanced manufacturing apprenticeships and unveil an industry-vetted additive manufacturing/3D printing technician registered apprenticeship framework.

The new framework leverages learnings directly from the America Makes Workforce and Education Roadmap and empowers employers nationwide to develop and customize AM/3DP apprenticeships to create a highly skilled workforce.

This Apprenticeship Works event will be held on the campus of America Makes member Youngstown State University.

RCBI, a founding member of America Makes, leads Apprenticeship Works-the National Advanced Manufacturing Apprenticeship Program, which is an American Apprenticeship Initiative supported by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Through Apprenticeship Works, RCBI works with partners across the United States to expand apprenticeship opportunities in advanced manufacturing, making them more accessible and affordable for employers.

""With the creation of the AM Technician Registered Apprenticeship framework, together RCBI and America Makes, working in conjunction with the America Makes membership community, have developed an invaluable, industry-vetted framework to help U.S. employers offer customizable curriculum and training programs to establish registered apprenticeship opportunities within their organizations,"" continues Ms. Thompson.

""We are proud of the AM Technician Registered Apprenticeship framework and our collaboration with RCBI, as it also served as a great opportunity to build on an already positive, long-standing relationship.""

Occupational frameworks provide an outline of what an apprentice will learn on the job, as well as through related training.

The new AM framework was developed out of the work led by the America Makes Workforce and Education task force, which also includes Tooling U-SME, another Apprenticeship Works partner, as well as many manufacturers that assisted in the development of the framework.

For employers, the return on investment of apprenticeships is substantial.

Apprenticeship programs help employers upskill incumbent workers and allow employers to hire unskilled workers and lead them on a journey to become highly skilled workers.

As a result, these organizations improve productivity and profitability, retain highly skilled workers, reduce turnover, and attract better applicants.

""We are excited about the creation and release of the AM Technician Registered Apprenticeship framework as part of our Apprenticeship Works Program,"" says Lucinda Curry, Director of Apprenticeship Works, RCBI. ""America Makes, along with its membership community, was crucial to the successful creation of the new framework, which is the first and only AM registered apprenticeship framework to be vetted by the industry.""

In addition to the release of the new framework the Apprenticeship Works forum will also feature Eric M. Seleznow, senior advisor, Jobs for the Future, presenting on ""How Apprenticeship Programs Work for Employers."" Representatives from Mohawk Flooring, Weyerhaeuser, Butech Bliss, Reddog Industries, and Martin Engineering, will share their insights about and experience with apprenticeships.

All three of the bills have been referred to their respective committees.

Another, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, passed the House of Representatives in June 2017.

It would reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, which provides more than $1 billion a year in federal funds for job training programs nationwide.

There is broad support for the measure and reportedly a commitment from the Senate to take it up soon.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, this bill would allow students enrolled in short-term job training programs to use federal Pell Grants to earn industry-based credentials.

""It tries to right-size the financial aid system in a way that allows people to be able to access credentials that actually matter to employers, rather than having them enroll in a two- or four-year program to receive aid,"" said Kermit Kaleba, federal policy director at the National Skills Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy research and advocacy group.

Under current law, Pell Grants-needs-based grants for low-income and working students-can only be applied toward programs that are over 600 hours or at least 15 weeks in length, while many job training programs are shorter term.

""There are many high-quality, short-term credentials recognized by employers which should be eligible for Pell Grants,"" said Mary Gardner Clagett, senior director of workforce policy at Jobs for the Future, a national nonprofit that develops programs and public policies that bridge education and work to build a more highly skilled, competitive workforce.

The Virginia Community College System has identified approximately 50 programs that would benefit from the JOBS Act, including ones in manufacturing, construction, energy, health care, information technology, transportation and business management.

""Often, the people who can gain the most by obtaining an industry-certified postsecondary credential cannot afford the training necessary to earn it,"" said Glenn DuBois, chancellor of Virginia's Community Colleges.

""These programs neither take as long nor cost as much as traditional college degree programs, but are still beyond the reach of many people without financial aid. Changing that will help not only individual job-seekers but also the employers who need to hire qualified, highly skilled candidates to fill good-paying jobs right now.""

Kaleba explained that there is a good chance that changes to eligibility requirements for Pell Grants will happen this year as part of legislation reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, especially after the White House specifically identified the issue as a priority.

Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., and Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., the PARTNERS Act would support regional industry partnerships between businesses and local workforce stakeholders to enable small- and medium-sized employers to develop and expand apprenticeships and other work-based learning programs.

""Businesses-especially small- and medium-sized businesses-often lack the infrastructure to establish apprenticeships or work-based learning programs on their own,"" Kaleba said.

""A small business doesn't typically have an internal training department or even an HR department, so launching an apprenticeship program becomes daunting.""

Industry-sector partnerships to develop the local workforce have been successful, experts agreed.

""A group of employers in an industry sector get together and pool their aggregate resources to work with local educational partners and workforce development boards to design education and training programs for that industry based on the specific needs of the region,"" Clagett said.

These types of networks have expanded apprenticeships and other work-based learning to employers that haven't traditionally participated in apprenticeship programs, and also within occupational fields that have not traditionally offered apprenticeships, she said.

""The bill would also provide funding to help support workers with barriers, who are especially critical for employers searching for talent during this tight labor market,"" Kaleba said.

""It provides additional resources to help with transportation or child care or other factors that may make it difficult to look for or stick with a job.""

It would support grants for work-based learning and apprenticeship programs to develop a pipeline of skilled workers specifically for infrastructure jobs in fields like transportation, construction and energy.

Kaine and Portman introduced the Senate version of BUILDS in 2017.

Employers in infrastructure industries face intense labor shortages because of impending retirements, a lack of diversity, and skills shortages in advanced fields.

The immediate future doesn't look any brighter.

There are 68 percent more projected job openings in infrastructure over the next five years than there are students training for these jobs, according to a 2015 report from the U.S. Department of Education.

President Donald Trump recently announced a $1.5 trillion plan to rebuild the nation's highways, bridges and other infrastructure.

""While the president proposes investing in the country's infrastructure, the plan doesn't yet identify any new funding to support workforce development,"" Clagett said.

""If we're really going to invest in infrastructure, we need to significantly invest in skills development to prepare the people who will be needed to perform this work.""

He made that decision as he was approaching his senior year at Plymouth High School.

""I didn't feel like spending thousands of dollars to go to school when I wasn't even sure what I wanted to be.""

""I did know that I liked working in the trades,"" Nichols said, adding he had worked constructing houses with his grandfather and had also worked for a heating and cooling company for a summer.

""My entire family has been involved in the trades for as long I can remember,"" he said.

Nichols reinforced that practical experience by taking tech classes in high school in a number of areas, including metal and woodworking and auto maintenance.

""I was lucky in that my school offered so many programs in the trades,"" Nichols said.

""After taking all those classes, I realized that construction was what I liked the most of all of them.""

The Youth Apprenticeship Program became a viable option during the latter part of his junior year in high school.

""My mom said that I could either go to college or workthose were my two options, so I decided I'd rather work,"" Nichols said.

He and his mother looked into the Youth Apprenticeship Program through Lakeshore Technical College.

""I got my application all finished and sent it in and Kohler Co. was the first to get back to me,"" Nichols said.

So during the summer before his senior year, Nichols started working a typical 8-hour day in the Facilities Maintenance Department at Kohler.

Once school started in the fall, Nichols' day was divided in two.

""I worked from 6 to 9 a.m. at Kohler, and then my first class started at 10 a.m. in Plymouth,"" Nichols recalled.

He supplemented his practical experience by taking a construction class at Plymouth High.

""That was part of my requirements for being in the Youth Apprenticeship program; I had to take one or two courses that were involved with what I was doing in my job,"" he said.

At Kohler Co. is comprised of masons, painters and carpenters.

As a Youth Apprentice, Nichols was exposed to many elements of those skills.

""I mainly assisted my mentor with constructing cabinets and workbenches as well as hanging pictures, painting office walls, maybe doing a little brick work here and there,"" Nichols said.

Nichols admits the job was different than what he expected when he signed up for the Youth Apprenticeship program.

""When I applied for something in construction youth apprenticeship, I thought I was going to get a job in industrial building or home construction,"" he said.

""When Kohler called and gave me a rundown of what they all did, it intrigued me. It's a different kind of building, different kind of work, but it's the same conceptsyou have to know how to use all the tools and know all the same skills that you would if you were out with a company building houses.""

Along with building a variety of things, Nichols also built a career.

A month or so before the end of his senior year in high school, Nichols was approached by his boss with an offer of a full-time job, replacing a person who was retiring.

""That was a pretty huge deal because in order to get a position in skilled trades at Kohler, you usually have to work for several years in production and have trades background before you can get in. I really got a jump ahead,"" he said.

""It was an excellent opportunity.""

He's also very thankful for the assistance of his fellow workers.

""The nice thing is that lots of the guys I work with have been doing this work for so long that if I'm stumped by something, I can ask them. I'm still learning on the job. This has worked out very well for me. I'm very happy with the way things have been going so far."""

The Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry recently approved Milton Hershey School's pre-apprenticeship program-the first of its kind in the state.

The pre-apprenticeship program at MHS will give students the ability to work in their desired trade or work industry prior to graduation.

""We are pleased to offer our students a pre-apprenticeship program where they will learn 21st century skills in many lucrative career fields,"" MHS President Pete Gurt '85 said.

""As we lead the way for pre-apprenticeship programs in the state, we are eager for our students to pursue postgraduate opportunities that will set them up for success and ultimately lead them to fulfilling and productive lives.""

MHS received approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry's Apprenticeship Council on Feb. 8 to implement the first state-registered pre-apprenticeship opportunity through its Career and Technical Education program.

The council also approved the state's first ""Hybrid"" apprenticeship affiliation through the school, connecting a student's work-based learning experiences in high school to a potential career directly after graduation.

Culinary Arts is the first pre-apprenticeship pathway to be offered to MHS students.

MHS and Hershey Entertainment & Resorts have formalized an agreement to offer the pre-apprenticeship opportunity to MHS students who would like to pursue a culinary career.

Students also could graduate with a pre-apprenticeship certificate.

""By partnering with Hershey Entertainment & Resorts, we are furthering our commitment together to provide students with meaningful career opportunities,"" Director of Career and Technical Education Dave Curry said.

""As the first state-registered pre-apprenticeship program in PA, our goal is for our students to receive hands-on experiences while in high school and to join the world of work with the necessary training and skills to succeed.""

Within the HE&R agreement, any MHS students who may be hired by HE&R postgraduation will have the opportunity to continue working in an adult apprenticeship program while gaining weekly educational training.

Currently, there are more than 1,000 apprenticeships available in Pennsylvania.

MHS is working to provide pre-apprenticeship opportunities to students in all of the school's 11 career pathways.

As part of that commitment, Rockingham County Manager Lance Metzler proclaimed February to be Career and Technical Education Month in Rockingham County on Feb. 12, just before the invitation event of the county's new apprenticeship program.

""County leaders are excited and appreciative to see that many partners are coming together to expand Career and Technical Education programs in our community,"" Metzler said.

Rockingham County Schools CTE Director Ken Scott added, ""Career and Technical Education is simply a group of professionals who collaborate together to help young people discover what their talents are, what their abilities are and help them translate that into - what? A job.""

The proclamation served as a kick off to the invitational event in which 32 students vyed to do just that through the Rockingham Apprenticeship and Technical Opportunities Partnership program.

As part of the RockATOP invitational, students spend four days performing projects under the observation of company representatives, hoping to line themselves up a paid apprenticeship.

If all goes well at the invitational, students may choose and possibly get matched up with a summer pre-apprenticeship which could lead directly into a two-to-four year full apprenticeship.

In this program, students work, get paid a salary and graduate with an associate's degree, a journeyman's certificate and no debt.

""We are starting with six companies,"" said RCS Career Counselor and RockATOP Public Information Officer Lydia Craddock.

""Our goal is, next year, to have 12 companies involved in this, and our goal after that is the sky is the limit. Right now our apprenticeships are in advanced manufacturing and so we are exploring the idea of offering apprenticeships in other areas as well.""

RockATOP representatives presented the new program to 1,600 students and piqued the interest of 186.

Officials whittled the list down to 72 eligible students based on grades, attendance and career options.

After open houses at the participating companies, 32 students remained interested and moved on to the invitational.

""Some people think this is too good to be true and at first glance you might think so, but the companies need this,"" Craddock said.

""The companies need this skilled labor, and they have joined in with us and they're taking a big step to take these students in as apprentices.""

Rockingham County Commissioner Mark Richardson offered brief remarks at the proclamation ceremony wearing a RockATOP polo shirt.

The event offered insights from companies partnering with ApprenticeshipNH about how the program benefits their employees and the community.

ApprenticeshipNH, a grant-funded program housed at the Community College System of New Hampshire, provides workers with invaluable opportunities to pursue higher-skilled, better-paying jobs, and opportunities for employers to enhance the skill-sets of their current and future employees.

More than 40 local businesses and others interested learning more about partnering with ApprenticeshipNH or opportunities within the program where in attendance.

The event featured a panel discussion with representatives from companies partnering with ApprenticeshipNH, as well as CCSNH staff.

Panelists included Dr. Ross Gittell, chancellor of CCSNH, Dwight Davis, president of Senior Helpers of the Greater Seacoast, and Sean Hoeing, organizational development specialist for Safran Aerospace Composites in Rochester.

Davis began working with GBCC and the ApprenticeshipNH program last fall.

We were restricted in our ability to fulfill clients needs prior to getting involved with the Registered Apprenticeship program, he said.

If you cant provide service for clients, you are not growing.

Through ApprenticeshipNH, they started a Home Health Aid training program with GBCC. The program consists of 144 hours of classroom instruction and 2,000 hours of on-the-job training, and provides students with training and skills and a national certification upon completion of the apprenticeship.

Diane Yocum, of Exeter, a student in the Home Health Aid program has worked for Senior Helpers for three years.

I know enough to get by but dont have a credential, Yocum said.

Dwight and Gayle Davis, of Senior Helpers urged me to take this program.

I was a little apprehensive in the beginning but Ive learned so much in just one month.

I was a stay-at-home mom for many years and decided to re-enter the workforce and turn a new chapter in my life,"" she said.

""When I saw this opportunity, I fell in love with the whole program.

The instructor is awesome not just my teacher, but my advisor.

Senior Helpers, the company sponsor, is a huge support in matching me with clients and introducing me to the job.

Sean Hoenig said Safran has benefitted from the apprenticeship model by helping to fill employment needs in much-needed areas including nondestructive testing, maintenance technician and advanced composite manufacturing in general.

The incumbent workers that are committed to our company and project in Rochester are the first people we want to invest in, he said.

Since winning the White House, most of the achievements affecting this core constituency have landed on the negative side of the ledger.

During the past thirteen months, the President and his administration have unveiled a long list of decidedly anti-worker decisions.

One example will suffice: Just as black lung, the fatal coal miners' disease, is making a strong reappearance - ""We've gone from having nearly eradicated this in the mid-1990s to the highest concentration of cases that anyone has ever seen,"" said NIOSH epidemiologist Scott Laney-David Zatezalo, Trump's choice to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration, was confirmed by the Senate, despite his lousy safety record.

While Zatezalo was serving as chairman of Rhino mines in West Virginia, OSHA issued nearly $2.1 million in fines for 160 workplace safety or health violations at Rhino mines, since the beginning of 2005.

On the face of it, one of the President's proposals looks like a good idea-to expand apprenticeship opportunities.

The plan calls for the creation of 4.5 million new apprenticeships within five years, about a ten-fold increase in the current number.

Fulfilling this dream will require much more than a signature on an Executive Order.

What's so appealing about apprenticeships? Apprentices earn as they learn.

They get a livable wage while acquiring a skill, a skill that's transportable and in demand.

Since, as the baby boomers are rapidly ageing out of skilled jobs, the Millennial generation is not that interested in pursuing careers in the trades.

Enrollment in vocational education has dropped, as has the educational commitment to vocation education programs, while the opioid epidemic is sapping the workforce, and a common complaint from employers emphasizes the deep-seated skills problem and lack of job readiness.

Millions of job opportunities will become available for those individuals with the talent and skill to fill them.

Some look to Germany as a model, since it has a long tradition of training its workers.

They employ a system of vocational training and apprenticeships that encompasses fully half of German youth, and prepares their workforce for over 300 occupations.

These range from the skilled blue-collar trades to white collar occupations such as administrative jobs, professional engineers, and technology specialists.

Even German bakers learn their trade within the vocational system.

While fewer than 5 percent of American youth train as apprentices, in Germany, the figure is closer to 60 percent.

As is usually the case when we look to Europe for comparisons, there are vast differences between the U.S. and other countries, such as Germany.

First and foremost, European countries, including Germany, have a high rate of unionization.

The standards and certification, as per a law enacted in 1969, are formulated by an agreement of unions and management.

Unlike the U. S., regulation is not a dirty word in Germany.

Strict regulations and standards of certification are imposed.

Another essential component that differs is funding.

Both the German government and German employers, including the major corporations, are deeply committed to financing the system.

Estimates for corporate / employer contributions range from $25,000 per apprentice to more than $80,000, according to Tamar Jacoby, writing in The Atlantic, while the German state pays for the tuition.

It's been a long time since American corporations have invested heavily in their workforces.

The price tag for Donald Trump's apprenticeship proposal is $200 million.

This figure, while absurdly inadequate to train a new generation of workers, flies in the face of the president's proposed budget, with cuts to the Department of Labor's funding by 21 percent, along with other cuts to training and employment services.

The $200 million allotted for the new workforce development program is arrived at by pulling funding from already existing job-training programs.

This is a short synopsis of the issues facing such a program.

Suffice it to say that, while the Germans spend billions preparing their workforce, we are being treated to another instance of populist B.S.."

""Apprenticeships hold great promise in helping American workers acquire the skills they need to get good jobs while ensuring companies can attract the talent required to succeed in this fast-moving global economy."" - Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta.

In 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provided federal funding for new types of apprenticeships and job training.

It brought local employers, community colleges and job training programs together to identify the skills needed for nearby jobs.

Most recently, this summer, the US government signed an executive order to substantially increase the number of U.S. apprenticeships from the current 500,000 by doubling the amount the government spends on apprenticeship programs.

Today, there are over 533,000 apprenticeships available nationwide in more than 1,000 occupations across multiple industries.

Plus, the average starting salary of an apprentice is $60,000, and apprentices earn $300,000 more over the course of their career!

Apprenticeships could bring the US in line with the low unemployment levels and strong manufacturing sectors in countries like Germany and Switzerland.

These countries are paying high wages and are able to achieve their economic strength by prioritizing apprenticeships and other education models that integrate classroom learning with on-the-job training.

In an apprenticeship, participants are earning and learning both on and off the job.

This differs from many other employment-related programs and purely classroom-based education.

This typically three- or four-year endeavor allows the apprentice to acquire new skills under the watchful eyes of a trained mentor.

""Apprenticeship is the other college. It'sreal-world application of the things you're learning I guess it's more of in a board game where you skip ahead 4 spaces and advance to payday."" -.

One or two days each week are dedicated to classwork at a local community college or technical school, but no college debt is accrued.

Better still, apprentices earn while they learn, and most are gainfully employed by the conclusion of their apprenticeship, according to the Department of Labor.

""One of the reasons why I didn't gointo college right away was because I knew that dealing with debt at such a young age especially can be very very stressful."" -.

How many full-time college students can say the same?

How Apprenticeships Work Most apprenticeships are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and sponsored by employers, trade organizations or labor unions.

You've most likely heard of apprenticeships in more common fields like plumbers, electricians, carpenters and other roles within the construction industry, but did you know apprenticeships are available in jobs like computer programming, insurance claim adjusters and even culinary arts?

Typically apprentices are hired as contractors, combining classroom instruction with on-the-job training.

The programs range in length from 1 to 6 years depending on the field, and the prerequisites are a High School Diploma or equivalent.

This makes it easy for those entering the workforce to acquire skills in a specific industry so they can begin earning a living at a younger age, in addition to coming out of the program with no college debt.

Should You Implement an Apprenticeship Program? Apprenticeships are more popular in the UK than the US, so one of the first barriers to consider is that there is not as much awareness around apprenticeships and their benefits in the US. Employers who are looking into Apprenticeship programs should know that the reduced attrition, financial tax credits and improvement to the skills gap in your talent pool are some of the greatest benefits to Apprenticeships.

The return on your investment is best explained by, whose company has implemented Apprenticeships,.

""We find that it's a lower risk and higher loyalty way to bring employees into our company. Traditionally you're going to spend money on marketing, you're going to offer referral fees for people recommending employees, you're going to expereince high turnover, you're going to have training... And these are huge costs that often result in employees burning out and leaving your company after a few months. With apprenticeships we're able to build working relationships with our employees before they come on board and build long term loyalty that pays off in the long run.""

How to Start an Apprenticeship Program Before establishing an apprenticeship program, you must identify the roles within your organization that will most likely benefit.

Jobs for which it is difficult to find workers with the right skills?Positions with high turnover?Occupations where a highly skilled workforce is retiring soon?Challenges helping workers keep pace with continuing industry advances?Positions requiring skills that can be learned on the job?Difficulty in attracting new and more diverse talent pools?Once you've determined the roles, you'll want to collaborate with strategic partners.

Employers can turn to a number of partners, such as: State Apprenticeship Agencies.

Then look for a technology partner who can serve as a strategic advisor in the management of your program and provide needed key features like: Soft and simple approach to engage.

Last year, he asked President Donald Trump to create five million jobs through apprenticeships.

Although Benioff admitted this was a ""Moonshot request,"" the president accepted the challenge.

The most surprising aspect of this challenge is the new approach tech titans are taking.

Traditionally, apprenticeships helped those pursuing blue-collar careers.

Companies like IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft all have tech-based apprenticeships.

Although I've never participated in nor offered an apprenticeship program, I've been an intern many times over and developed and managed multiple internship programs.

After hearing about the surge in apprenticeships, I was inspired to learn more about them.

Mary Beth Wynn is the senior vice president of people at Jellyvision, a Chicago-based employee communication platform.

The company has both an apprenticeship and an internship program.

While both are valuable, they aren't interchangeable.

She pointed out that the goal of an internship is to provide college students exposure to a specific career path.

The program helps them make more educated decisions about their futures.

There's an understanding that, with most internships, the intern is only with a company for a short time - typically between eight and 16 weeks.

Once the internship is over, they return to their academic studies.

Apprentices are often younger - still in high school.

The learning objectives of the program and their academic studies are aligned for a period of 12 months or more with the goal of full-time employment at the end.

Leaders everywhere are striving to increase their company's diversity.

As Re:work Training discovered, apprenticeships are one possible answer.

""Companies are boasting about their focus on diversity,"" said Harrison Horan, founder and CEO of the Chicago-based sales training and job placement nonprofit.

""If a company genuinely wants diversity, their recruiting and management teams need to genuinely evaluate people with diverse educational backgrounds.""

Re:work seeks diversity by providing apprenticeships to Chicago's underprivileged communities.

The company reports that, on average, participants increase their income by 239 percent.

This brings more diverse talent to the companies while helping break people out of the cycle of poverty.

These apprenticeship programs help former military members translate their skills and work ethic to a tech environment.

Many veterans have already received extensive and valuable training.

Whether personal or professional, the key to any successful relationship is open communication.

The same goes for the relationship between an employer and an apprentice.

Apprenticeship programs simply don't work without transparency.

""Try to give them as much information as you can about the likelihood of being hired on full-time at the end of the program,"" Wynn said.

Wynn went on to say that about 50 to 60 percent of Jellyvision apprentices become full-time employees.

Regardless of whether or not an apprentice transitions into a full-time role, prioritizing open communication instills a greater sense of transparency within the apprentice.

They'll carry that value with them into their next role, whether it's with your organization or another.

You don't have to be well-established to create an apprenticeship program.

There are several organizations that offer help developing effective apprenticeship programs for companies of all sizes.

Apprenti is a tech apprenticeship program based in Redmond, Washington, with locations across the company.

The organization partners with companies looking for great tech employees.

Apprenti trains the talent so employers don't have to start from scratch and spend money creating their own program.

The DOL also has a list of resources about the most efficient ways to create an apprenticeship program, details on tax incentives the government offers, and advice on reaching out to local labor organizations.

These tools and resources make it easier to establish an apprenticeship program on a lower budget, thus removing a major barrier in implementation."

""Even in this time of economic growth, many small businesses across numerous industries are struggling to find qualified workers,"" Rep. Fitzpatrick said during a bipartisan House Small Business Committee field hearing held in Newportville, Pa., at the Boilermakers Local Lodge No. 13.

The so-called skills gap disproportionately affects small businesses and skilled trades, according to the House Small Business Committee, and ""If left unaddressed, this skills gap will not only impact businesses and workers but lead to significant economic spillovers throughout the nation,"" said Fitzpatrick, a committee member who chaired the hearing.

U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans, also a member of the House committee, joined Fitzpatrick at the event.

The committee's field hearing convened labor, business and education stakeholders to consider how federal programs aid or impede workforce development initiatives that are intended to support small businesses and local trade unions.

Fitzpatrick said the hearing was ""The first step in understanding the causes of the skills gap and finding areas for potential improvement within our existing workforce development programs in all sectors.""

""Students must be prepared for careers or further education and workers must be able to adapt and continually acquire the training and skills required in the modern workplace,"" said witness Alex Halper, director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry.

""Unfortunately, feedback from PA chamber members and employers around the Commonwealth has made it clear we are falling short of these goals.""

One hearing witness suggested that apprenticeships provide a bright path to the future.

Susan Herring, interim executive director of the Bucks County Community College Center for Workforce Development, said the college's pre-apprenticeship programs have been ""Life-transforming opportunities"" for students facing employment barriers tied to personal challenges, such as addiction, homelessness, incarceration, single parenthood, and disability.

Herring also pointed out that the success of workforce development programs ""Begins and ends with the symbiotic relationship we have built with the manufacturing business community,"" which she said assists in myriad ways, including ""Developing and refining the curriculum, vetting training candidates, offering company tours, and hiring our graduates.""

Rep. Fitzpatrick is a strong congressional supporter of apprenticeship programs.

Among several pieces of proposed legislation he supports this congressional term, Fitzpatrick is one of four original cosponsors of the bipartisan Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act of 2017, H.R. 3707, introduced on Sept. 7, 2017, by U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez.

The bill would amend tax law to allow employers to take a business-related tax credit of up to $5,000 for training a qualified person in a qualified apprenticeship program or a multi-employer apprenticeship program recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, according to the congressional record summary.

H.R. 3707 is awaiting consideration by the House Committees on Ways and Means, and Education and the Workforce."

While these provisions are often entitled ""Safe and code compliant construction"" and may be perceived as fostering apprenticeship programs for building construction trades, many contractors on Long Island disagree.

They see these provisions as having nothing to do with safety or compliance.

They point out that many of these codes do not require that apprentices work on the project or that the selected contractor even employ such apprentices.

Rather, all that is required is that the contractor have a collective bargaining agreement with a union that has a qualified apprenticeship program.

They contend that these code provisions are aimed at ensuring that contractors affiliated with certain unions get the jobs by prohibiting non-unionized contractors or unionized contractors with affiliated unions that do not meet the qualified apprenticeship program requirement from getting building permits.

They further argue that these provisions add significant costs to the price of construction.

A recent decision by a federal judge may be changing that.

A sampling of codes provisions on Long Island that require qualified apprenticeship programs for building permits.

Section 87-55.1 of the Huntington Town Code provides that prior to the issuance of ""Building permits for the construction of commercial buildings of at least one hundred thousand square feet,"" applicants must ""Demonstrate that any general contractor, contractor or subcontractor for such project, must have apprenticeship agreements appropriate for the type and scope of work to be performed, which have been registered with, and approved by, the New York State Commissioner of Labor in accordance with Article 23 of the New York Labor Law."".

Under Brookhaven's code provision, unless an existing building has a certificate of occupancy or its equivalent, the square footage of the existing building is included in the calculation of the 100,000 square foot threshold.

Town of North Hempstead. Section 24-68 of the North Hempstead Town Code provides the following.

""Every contractor or subcontractor who is a party to, or working under, a construction contract with the Town shall be a participant in good standing in a qualified apprenticeship program that is registered with and approved by the DOL and shall have in place apprenticeship agreements that specifically identify or pertain to the trade(s) and/or job title(s) called for within the construction contract.""

Section 2-9.1 of the North Hempstead Code requires that prior to issuance of a building permit for a ""Large commercial project,"" the applicant must demonstrate that ""Any general contractor, contractor or subcontractor for such project is a participant in good standing in a qualified apprenticeship program that is registered with and approved by the DOL and has apprenticeship agreements, which are specifically identified as pertaining to the trade(s) and/or job title(s) called for by such project.""

A ""Large commercial project"" is defined as ""[t]he erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, removal, improvement, renovation, demolition or conversion of a commercial building or structure where such erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, removal, improvement, renovation, demolition or conversion involves an area of 100,000 square feet or more of floor area.

The threshold of 100,000 square feet may be met either in a single building or a collection of buildings located on the same property.

Section 7-48 of the City of Long Beach Code of Ordinances covers apprenticeship requirements.

It provides that ""As a condition precedent for, the issuance of all building permitsfor construction of buildings of at least 100,000 square feetany contractor or subcontractor, who is a party to, or working under, a construction contract, [must] be a participant in good standing of a qualified apprenticeship program that is registered with and approved by the New York State Department of Labor and to have apprenticeship agreementswhich have been registered with, and approved by, the New York State Commissioner of Labor in accordance with Article 23 of the New York Labor Law."".

Sections 93-16.1 and 93-16.2 apply this provision to buildings of 100,000 square feet or more, and have other refinements to that 100,000 square foot threshold.

A legal challenge to Oyster Bay's provisions is pending in the federal court in Central Islip.

That case is entitled Hartcorn Plumbing and Heating, Inc. v Town of Oyster Bay.

Plaintiffs contend that Oyster Bay's code is unconstitutional as it applies not just to contracts that the Town is a party to or funds, but also applies to wholly private contracts.

On February 7, 2018, Judge Hurley issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Town of Oyster Bay from enforcing Town Code 93-16.3, with respect to any contract that the Town of Oyster Bay is not a ""Direct or indirect party."" As a result, at least for now, projects that do not involve the Town of Oyster Bay as a party to the contract or are not funded by the town can get building permits without demonstrating that their contractors participate in ""Qualified apprenticeship programs."" Whether that ruling is ultimately upheld as the case proceeds is unknown, but it may result in other municipalities reexamining their code provisions voluntarily or as a result of similar court challenges."

St. Cloud State University announced recently it is developing courses and hands-on learning in quantum encryption, a critical new area of cybersecurity.

The university obtained $277,000 grant from the National Security Agency for the expansion of its Center of Academic Excellence-Cybersecurity Education Programs.

The money will be used to develop quantum encryption programming.

Mark Schmidt, professor of Information Systems, said in a news release that viable quantum encryption systems have the potential to change the way data is protected and transmitted over the Internet.

The first quantum information systems courses at St. Cloud State will be offered online during the upcoming summer sessions.

The courses will be available at the undergraduate and graduate level and will be open to both St. Cloud State and non-degree seeking students.

Additional courses in quantum encryption will be offered during the 2018-19 school year.

Quantum key cryptography is being under taught in cybersecurity programs because of a lack of academic expertise and educational materials available in the subject, Schmidt said.

Herberger Business School and the Department of Information Systems are using the CAE-C grant to develop curriculum covering the difficult concepts of quantum encryption that could then be used or modeled by others.

College to teach Geospatial Intelligence Analysis online.

Northland Community & Technical College in Thief River Falls announced last month it will take its Geospatial Intelligence Analysis program online this coming fall.

According to the college, the move will allow Northland to train students around the world for careers ranging from military intelligence to retail marketing.

The geospatial intelligence analysis industry is called GeoInt.

In basic terms, the college said, GeoInt is the practice of interpreting images of Earth, geo-referencing them and identifying objects, structures and patterns to make actionable recommendations.

""We train our students to turn images into digital maps with pieces of information layered on top, much like a flip book,"" explained Steve Sorenson, one of NCTC's program instructors.

""Looking at the recent California fires, for example, we can map the fires and then look to see what extent the damage is, how it will impact towns and how to plan evacuations, all based on these layered maps we produce.""

Northland's aerospace programs - including those that train aviation maintenance and drone technicians - have all earned reputations for excellence since the department was created more than 50 years ago.

Nearly 80 percent of companies across all industries rely on some sort of geospatial data.

Northland said companies, farmers and municipalities rely on geospatial data for things like mapping new retail locations, planning new communities or forecasting crop yields.

For consumers, Google Earth may be the most obvious example of GeoInt in action.

These maps of planet Earth are layered with information like street names, businesses, road conditions, etc.

Behind all that functionality sits an expert technician trained in analyzing images and providing actionable intelligence in the form of a map.

More than 4 million jobs are directly linked to digital maps, explained Jon Beck, an instructor at Northland.

""The economic impact is more than a trillion dollars yearly in terms of sales for businesses,"" he said in the release.

""But beyond the economics, geospatial intelligence is enormously valuable to society as a whole. For example, emergency response teams digital maps created with geospatial imagery and data have decreased response time by about 20 percent in situations where someone's life is on the line. You wouldn't typically think of a map as a lifesaver, but the maps we create can do just that."""

As expected, the future of work featured prominently in these conversations.

As mayors and other local policymakers from across the country discussed the record number of unfilled jobs, a fluctuating economy and an increased demand for skilled workers, we all agreed that workforce development is vital to ensuring the ongoing prosperity of our cities and country.

With that focus here in D.C., our economy is one of the strongest in America.

The District welcomes nearly 1,000 new residents each month and is home to a rapidly growing small business sector that is the envy of the country.

D.C. also has the nation's most educated workforce.

Despite our strong economy and vibrant workforce, the region faces a significant skills gap.

Roughly 60,000 D.C. residents have not graduated high school or earned a GED. More than 25,000 residents are unemployed - even as 30,000 new jobs have been added to the economy.

Maintaining, and even increasing, the level of collaboration between the public and private sector is essential to ensuring that the future of work in this country is bright, both for D.C. residents and all Americans.

The District has launched new programs that allow residents to earn wages while they learn new skills.

The success of these programs is dependent on involvement of the business community.

Nationally recognized initiatives like the D.C. Infrastructure Academy and ApprenticeshipDC partner with local businesses to offset the costs of training, connect to a highly skilled workforce and equip job seekers with the skills necessary to attain quality work.

Under the leadership of Mayor Muriel Bowser, and in concert with key business and community partners, these workforce initiatives have fueled incredible progress.

Of the nearly 100,000 residents who have used DOES services during Mayor Bowser's tenure, more than 35,000 are employed today, demonstrating a more than 85 percent retention rate for job seekers who complete District-sponsored workforce training programs.

Strengthening partnerships with the business community can bring these numbers even higher.

Early work experiences play a significant role in long-term career development and overall success.

Applications for the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program recently closed, but we need local businesses to join with us to provide District youth, ages 14 to 24, with enriching and constructive summer work experiences.

Effective municipal workforce development programs and systems that respond to the needs of residents - and employers - are fundamental to promoting equitable access to economic opportunity.

These efforts connect public resources to the private sector and to families.

Job seekers have more opportunities for meaningful work, companies hire from a highly motivated, better trained labor pool, and local economies grow.

At the Department of Employment Services, we're committed to ensuring that all Washingtonians get the fair shot they deserve and that our workforce and economic development strategies work well for our residents and businesses.

Publicly soliciting feedback about how DOES programs and services can be improved has enabled us to make substantive changes to how we approach service delivery.

By valuing what District stakeholders have to say about their local programs and service offerings, we have been able to double down on a commitment to create clear pathways to individual economic opportunities and deliver a more dynamic workforce.

Like our federal partners, D.C. is ""Open for business.""

205,Andrea Olson,3/2/2018 12:11,"duced"":""2%"",""sm_api_title"":""Office Apprenticeships Will Save Mid-Market Manufacturing"",""sm_api_content"":"" We talk a lot about apprenticeships within manufacturing, and many skilled positions require an apprenticeship prior to full time employment.

With many mid-market manufacturers struggling with a wave of Baby Boomer retirees, and business owners making challenging decisions on who will take up the mantle when they step away from the organization, apprenticeships are more important than ever.

Apprenticeships are used across all roles and industries in Europe.

Just search for 'office apprenticeships in the UK' and you'll find open, paid positions ranging from Business Administration to Product Management.

Here in the U.S., we look at these entry-level roles in the ""Front of the house"" operations as internships.

Internships and apprenticeships both give you hands on training, but that's where the similarities end.

Internships in the U.S. are readily available for most college students through their school or university and are often generalized rather than specified for a particular trade or industry.

When it comes to an internship, most people either do it for a semester or summer and then move on to the next one or get hired full-time.

With an apprenticeship, it can take years to complete and requires a full-time commitment.

An intern gets work experience, but an apprentice gets more than that - it typically has classroom instruction attached to it.

As we look to replace the ""Brain drain"" that is occurring within manufacturing, the industry needs to start examining how to capture this knowledge and transfer it to the next generation through apprenticeships.

Consider a Baby Boomer who has worked in a specific manufacturing industry for 30+ years.

They have worked in product development, and understand the historical changes in the product designs, how they function in the field, and how customers can effectively maintain and service them.

They know what the competitors have developed and where they are going next.

Enter the young, recent engineering graduate with no background in the industry.

How can this 'tribal knowledge' be effectively transferred? Is a traditional internship sufficient, where they typically work on small, insignificant projects and only learn the basic processes and operations of the company? Or is a full-fledged, paid apprenticeship, where the new hire is required to capture in-depth knowledge of the industry and product history more valuable?

Anyone who has completed an internship knows you aren't going to have too much responsibility.

Yes, you'll get to see how the marketing department works or how customer service operates, but chances are you won't be creating a marketing campaign or developing a new service protocol.

Often internships give people college credits, a small stipend or something to add to their resume, but doesn't add value to the employer.

The difference with an apprenticeship versus other types of training is that it can be directly tied to addressing knowledge transfer instead of simply teaching tactical skillsets of low value.

This is most critical to those industries where hands-on experience is key.

Think about those 'softer' areas in your organization where you have core team members that know your customers and industry inside and out - sales, marketing, customer service, product development, tech support and human resources.

The difference in these individuals is their experience, not solely technical training.

Leveraging the concept of office apprenticeships will enable manufacturers to bring in more young talent to the industry, retain organizational knowledge and set the stage for long term growth in the future.

So dump the internships and trade up for apprenticeships in the office."

The work-and-learn model simply works,"" said chief executive officer Jeff Stark.

""We believe the added structure at the state level for apprenticeships and work-based learning will help companies like Stark overcome their shortages of human capital. That's positive for both our company's growth and our local economy.""

To boost apprenticeship programs for working adults, the Office of Apprenticeship & Work-Based Learning will work with the U.S. Department of Labor to enhance and expand federally approved apprenticeships.

Beyond apprenticeships, the office will work closely with Indiana businesses and education providers to build more relevant work-based learning programs in emerging industries for a more diverse population of Hoosiers.

Finally, the office will work to better communicate and connect Hoosiers with apprenticeships and work-based learning opportunities around the state.

""As I travel around the state talking with Indiana businesses, I hear from many of them that finding skilled employees is a top concern to sustain and grow their companies,"" the governor said.

""This new office will create more work-based experiences that align industry needs with relevant skills training - with the ultimate goal of getting more Hoosiers into good jobs right now while preparing young people for tomorrow's economy.""

When Trump focuses almost exclusively on renegotiating NAFTA, imposing new tariffs, and other trade policy adjustments, he misses a large piece of the job-creation puzzle.

The Department of Labor has identified occupations with the highest projected domestic growth through 2026.

In these three sectors, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recognizes significant domestic labor shortages that are leaving millions of open positions.

These shortages should be the president's priority, more so than better trade deals.

Filling these gaps requires new educational strategies, not seven dragged-out rounds of trade negotiations.

Many employers and industry leaders point to a growing ""Skills gap"" that is making it difficult to find qualified workers for open jobs.

Leading economists maintain a dominant cause of these labor market shortages is over-education and a dearth of highly specific skills.

Peter Capelli, an economist at Trump's alma mater, the Wharton School of Business, says there is ""a substantial skill mismatch in the form of individuals with more education than their current jobs require.""

Another factor exacerbating labor market gaps is the expensiveness of college and the high dropout rates.

The six-year graduation rate for students beginning four-year degree programs in 2011 was below 60 percent.

College dropout rates in the United States are higher than any other developed country, as are tuition fees.

With average yearly college costs exceeding 20,000 dollars, nearly half of young adults claim they cannot continue their education because of the expense.

This is an exorbitantly high price, of time and money, to pay for an education that often fails to meet America's labor needs.

Filling the jobs of the future requires alternative educational pathways that are better-tailored to the needs of employers, and more attuned to student goals and budgets.

More attention should be given to vocational programs, especially apprenticeships.

Apprenticeships are playing an increasing role in workforce development that policymakers should look carefully at.

Traditionally limited to construction and skilled trade industries, apprenticeship programs are being adopted more and more in other sectors.

CVS has made investments in their pharmaceutical technician apprenticeship program, which has trained more than 1,500 employees since 2005.

In South Carolina, Blue Cross Blue Shield partnered with state technical colleges to develop an IT apprenticeship program that has placed over 240 employees since 2009.Apprenticeships have proven to be a worthy investment for businesses.

For every dollar invested in apprentice training, employers get back $1.47 in increased productivity.

Participants finish their programs debt-free with starting salaries of over $60,000.

The average graduate from a four-year college starts with an annual salary below $50,000.

Nearly 70 percent of bachelor's graduates finish with student loan debt, averaging over $30,000 per borrower.

It is puzzling apprenticeship is not a more popular alternative.

Countries like Austria, Switzerland, and Germany have 55 to 70 percent of their young people entering apprenticeship programs right out of high school.

Their model results in low youth unemployment rates, a steady supply of skilled workers, and high program completion rates.

Despite the president's gripes about the manufacturing jobs shipped overseas, new innovations have created unanswered demand in advanced manufacturing right here in America.

Without a reliable training pipeline, hundreds of thousands of these jobs are unfilled today.

To his credit, Trump has commended the value of vocational/technical schools and alternative education pathways.

He even signed an executive order last year calling for expansion of apprenticeships.

If he truly wants to be a ""Jobs, jobs, jobs"" president, Trump will borrow from his reality TV past and continue pushing for more apprenticeships.

There are currently 5.2 million unfilled jobs in industries like healthcare, finance, education, and information.

Filling these jobs requires forward-thinking educational solutions, not backward-reaching protectionist trade deals."
214,Sherri Buri McDonald,3/5/2018 3:56,"duced"":""4%"",""sm_api_title"":""Apprenticeship program gives tech sector a boost"",""sm_api_content"":"" The first dozen participants in the Apprenti technology apprenticeship program in Lane County are set to start classroom training this spring.

New to the Eugene-Springfield area, Apprenti is a tech apprenticeship program that meets the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, which helps fund it.

The purpose of Apprenti is twofold: to help fill immediate openings in the local tech industry and to draw more women, minorities and military veterans, who have traditionally been underrepresented in the industry.

""It has been positive to see the diversity of the people who are applying,"" said Jessica McCormick, workforce project manager at Lane Workforce Partnership and the Apprenti project lead for Lane County.

Officials with the partnership and the industry group Technology Association of Oregon had hoped to place 10 local apprentices in the first year of the program.

Fueled by interest from area companies and potential apprentices, the program is preparing to welcome an initial group of 12 apprentices, with the potential for more to start their classroom training this year.

The program will kick off with about six apprentices each in two occupations: network security administrators, who work with hardware and security software; and developer/operators, also known as dev/ops, a hybrid position that requires a mix of programming knowledge, network experience and project management, McCormick said.

""We chose these roles first because our hiring partners were asking for them,"" she said.

The classroom part of the program will begin between mid-April and early May. It will last 14 weeks for the network security administrators and 16 weeks for the developer/operators, McCormick said.

That will be followed by a year of on-the-job training at a local company.

By popular demand from local employers, the next group of apprentices will likely be Web developers, whose classroom training may start in June, McCormick said.

The number of people in that group hasn't yet been determined, she said.

Organizers have been pleased by how the program has been received.

""We weren't sure when we first went into this how many different occupations our local companies would want, and how many apprentices they would want to take on,"" McCormick said.

""The momentum has been a lot greater than we originally anticipated,"" she said.

Four other local companies are interested, but they're waiting to see how the first group of apprentices do, McCormick said.

Candidates interested in applying for an apprenticeship should go online to apprenti.org in the next 30 days and take an online test, McCormick said.

Organizers are still screening candidates for the initial 12 spots and beyond, but 142 have cleared the first hurdle of scoring high enough on the test, which covers math, logic, critical thinking and so-called ""Soft skills.""

Of the 142-person group, 72 are minorities, 46 are military veterans and 27 are women, according to information provided by McCormick.

Seventy of the 142 are white, 22 are Asian, 20 are black or African American, 19 are Latino, two are American Indian or Alaskan native and 2 are native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.

The first two groups of apprentices will attend class, most likely at the downtown Eugene Lane Community College.

Labs for apprentices to learn about equipment, such as switches and routers, are at Lane's main south Eugene campus, McCormick said.

Classes likely will run 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with the possibility of some evening labs, she said.

Apprenti will use LCC computer science faculty and additional instructors for the classroom training, McCormick said.

Funding for Lane County's program comes from the Department of Labor's American Apprenticeship Initiative.

The federal government invested $3 million in Oregon to expand registered apprenticeships into the information technology and manufacturing industries.

Of the $3 million, Lane Workforce Partnership received $383,796 through the state Employment Department.

The partnership is using the money to set up the local Apprenti program, to screen apprentice candidates before sending them to employers, monitor the training and to handle state and federal reporting.

""Typically that would fall on the shoulders of the employer,"" McCormick said.

""We wanted to make it fairly easy for employers to participate and take some of that burden off of them.""

Training costs also come from the $3 million federal investment in Oregon.

The state will pay up to $10,000 per apprentice to the program for the classroom training, McCormick said.

When the apprentice begins the on-the-job training, the host employer pays a placement fee to the program of $2,500 per apprentice, she said.

Program organizers check in with each apprentice during their on-the-job training at two months, five months and 10 months.

At 10 months, organizers ask employers if they plan to hire their apprentices.

If not, then the apprentices have two months before the program ends to update their ru00e9 sumu00e9 and find an opportunity with a different local company, McCormick said."

Instead, he found out about the job, and the Cement and Concrete Workers, District Council 16 Apprenticeship Program, in 2015.

""A friend who was in the union told me about it the night before registration,"" Corcino says.

""I was waiting outside the door at 10 p.m. - and I waited until the doors opened at 8 a.m. It was cold.""

Only the first 300 people on the line got an application; there are sometimes 400-450 hopefuls.

He attended two days of orientation, had a one-on-one interview on the third day, and then came back for an agility test, where applicants handle the type of materials they're expected to work with on a daily basis.

He was selected to participate in the program and he was on the job working less than a month later.

The program Corcino attended is a two-year program that requires 4000 work hours and 300 classroom hours to pass.

The work of a concrete laborer, which includes pouring and chopping concrete - often on a hanging scaffold on buildings over 1000 feet high - requires strength, nerves, and an attention to detail, all working together.

When patch pouring for window installers, making sure the window will fit correctly.

""We are the muscle on the job, on building construction,"" says District Council 16 Training Director Paul Primiano.

Previously, Corcino worked three part-time jobs, including in Fire Protection Services for residential and commercial construction sites.

As a younger man, he'd worked in the family business of flea markets in major markets in the Tri-State area such as Aqueduct.

His father, who has worked in Sanitation for 10 years, but still has the business on the side, taught him his work ethic and the value of providing for a family.

Says Corcino, ""I've always been an athletic and physical person. To get a career like this, is like someone who plays basketball in the park ending up in the NBA."".

Corcino's appreciation shows in his dedication.

Primiano cites his perfect attendance, willingness to stay for overtime, and ""Never say no"" attitude as just some of the reasons Corcino has won the LaborPress' Outstanding Apprentice nomination.

""All the foremen spoke very highly of him - he got great reviews,"" Primiano adds.

Not only that, but when a company called the union in a bind, looking for someone with a license to be on a suspended scaffold to do some work for a couple of days, Corcino, who has the license, ""Made it happen,"" managing to provide his services even though he was currently on a job.

He was valued highly enough where he was working that he was allowed to take the time to help out.

""It was totally selfless - a great example of giving back to the program,"" Primiano says.

""You have to be an exceptional individual because of how hard the work is. We've been called the Navy Seals of construction sites - no one ever sees us, but in the heat waves, and the coldest days of the year -we're there."""

Classes for the program, run by the South Louisiana Economic Council, will be held at Fletcher Technical Community College.

The program's goal is to provide short- and long-term technical training to local workers.

It is aimed at those in Assumption, Lafourche, St. Mary and Terrebonne parishes.

The program is based on a metal-working apprenticeship SLEC offered back in the 1990s.

The agency said it will reinstate that program, but there will be some revisions before it begins.

""The metal-working apprenticeship program back in the 90s had just one general purpose, welding,"" SLEC President and CEO Vic Lafont said.

""This one is going to be a hybrid apprenticeship program. It is going to cover three fields: One is in welding, one is in machine tooling, and the other one is in production technology.""

The integrated production technology field specializes in skills that prepare students for a career in the oil and gas and petrochemical industries.

Those who enroll will be able to get an Integrated Production Technology associate or an Applied Science degree.

SLEC will use a matching grant from the state Department of Economic Development to implement the program.

""It came from the Louisiana Department of Economic Development, so it's state budget, state funds,"" Lafont said.

The agency is working with Fletcher to provide instructors for the training.

As of now, there are three instructors, one per field, and the number of trainees is still to be determined.

The sign-up procedure is still being arranged, as it depends on the state and who will be able to take the applications.

""The state will either allow SLEC, since it is a SLEC apprenticeship program, take those applications or will allow the community college,"" Lafont said.

The program will provide classroom and practical experience and will prepare the students for employment in one of the three fields.

SLEC decided to apply for the grant because it does not want to wait for the economy to recover before workers begin training for the jobs it hopes will return, Lafont said.

""We want to prepare them now so they can join the workforce when they are needed,"" he said."

The framework, developed by the Robert C. Byrd Institute at Marshall University in conjunction with its partners, lays out a three-year course covering training from basic industrial safety to the history of 3-D printing and from computer-aided design to part design.

The final year of the apprenticeship program would cover materials, electrical systems, risk management and design economics.

""What they learn is a combination of job skills. Everyone learns leadership and communication skills to make them better employees,"" said Lucinda Curry, director of the Apprenticeship Works program at the Byrd Institute.

""There's so much to learn within the additive manufacturing arena and it's evolving every day. It's a constant learning process.""

Most of the program work - about three-quarters, Curry said - will be focused on the technical aspects while the remaining coursework will deal with health and safety, manufacturing basics and soft skills.

A full version of the apprenticeship framework and the required competencies can be found at the Byrd Institute's website.

The new program was unveiled Tuesday at the Expanding Apprenticeships Through Apprenticeships Works forum, hosted by America Makes at Youngstown State University.

Among the other Byrd Institute partners who contributed to developing the framework were the Society for Manufacturing Engineers, the National Coalition of Advanced Technology Centers, West Virginia Women Work and the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship.

""Their membership has vetted this program and given us input to what the industry needs are,"" Curry said.

""The technology has been around for years, but we're seeing new processes and materials. [It helps] stay ahead of the game and understand additive manufacturing design.""

Part of the apprenticeship program, which is available nationwide, Apprenticeship Works will provide employers with a learning management system to track the progression of on-the-job training and related technical instruction, or RTI. For on-the-job training, Apprenticeship Works will offer up to 80 hours of on-site supervisor training.

Apprentices in the program must complete at least 144 hours per year of online related technical instruction.

Development of the framework was funded by a $4.9 million grant from the Department of Labor.

With YSU's Center for Innovation in Additive Manufacturing now in its fourth year and development underway for the Mahoning Valley Innovation and Commercialization Center, vice president for research Michael Hripko said that incorporating the framework with curricula would be beneficial for students.

""When you're putting together an advanced manufacturing center, the facility is part of it, the equipment is part of it and so is the curriculum and programming,"" he said.

""What we're seeing is the opportunity to leverage existing apprenticeships programs that have been developed and proven, maybe incorporating them into our academic programs.""

It's not out of the question, he continued, for students to graduate from Youngstown State with both a degree and some of their apprenticeship work already completed.

""Imagine the capabilities of a candidate graduating from a university who can weld, machine and understand additive manufacturing processes,"" Hripko said.

""We can incorporate CAD, computer-aided analysis and data-enabled manufacturing. Those are some dimensions in the new manufacturing model we're incorporating.""

The additive manufacturing technician apprenticeship program marks the 17th program offered by the Byrd Institute.

In addition to those services, the institute, housed at Marshall University in Wheeling, W.Va.

Also offers CNC machine leasing, reverse engineering, machine set-up, online training and ISO certification training.

""It's anything from a short-term half-day class on nondestructive testing to a four-year apprenticeship to a two-year additive manufacturing technician program,"" Curry said.

""It's dependent on their needs and we want to help fill those gaps."""

Home improvement giant Lowe's has teamed up with Guild Education, an education network for working adults, to offer its employees a new avenue of development.

The Track to the Trades initiative is designed to present career alternatives to Lowe's employees and ensure they get the support they need to pursue those careers.

""We wanted to broaden the career spectrum for Americans and what they do,"" said Melody Thuston, senior PR specialist at Lowe's.

""Although we have long offered a tuition reimbursement program, the Track to the Trades initiative is a first of its kind by focusing specifically on pre-apprenticeships for skilled trades careers.""

Starting March 1, the collaborative initiative began rolling out in Charlotte, Denver, Pittsburgh and Richmond.

This brief, four-city pilot will be followed by nationwide implementation of the program.

Lowe's has plans for completion by the end of 2018.

The expanded application of the program will reach the company's more than 290,000 full- and part-time employees.

Those who choose to undergo the training enroll in six- to 10-month pre-apprenticeships that will set them up for careers in carpentry, HVAC, electrical, plumbing or appliance repair.

According to Lowe's research, these are the most in-demand sectors of the skilled trade industry.

The Track to the Trades program recognizes that employees likely will not be team members at Lowe's forever but encourages them to remain in the industries that they serve.

The program will offer eligible employees incentives to learn whether they choose to pursue a skilled trade after training or stay on with the company.

Learners will receive funding for skill certifications, academic coaching and support through Guild, as well as access to Lowe's network of contractors to search for apprenticeships after training.

""Our purpose of helping people love where they live requires having affordable and available contractors for home improvement projects,"" Thuston said.

""By taking critical steps today to invest in our own workforce, we can begin to solve this critical issue.""

Rachel Carlson, CEO of Guild, said that companies partnering with Guild saw around a 127 percent return on investment on average.

Lowe's expects increased retention and upped recruitment because of its newly updated benefits.

Aside from the obvious benefits to Lowe's and its employees, the new program is positioned to help remedy the larger problem of the dwindling number of skilled tradespeople in the workforce.

The skilled trades have been in a state of decline for nearly a decade.

As older generations leave physically demanding skilled work behind, younger workers have focused their careers elsewhere.

The skilled trade industries have faced a shortage of interested and able candidates.

""Leveraging BLS data, Lowe's believes there can be more than a half million commercial and residential construction jobs available by 2026,"" Thuston said.

Jobs in the skilled trades typically don't require a college degree, offer steady work and often offer competitive salaries and benefits.

""There's a real opportunity there, and opportunity for our students to advance their earning potential and grow their career in those trades,"" Carlson said.

These positions remain largely unfilled due to stigma around labor jobs.

Four-year degrees and traditional learning paths are heavily emphasized in America, and the skilled trades often are not seen as a viable career option, even as higher education remains out of reach for many frontline workers.

The skills gap continues to widen, primarily because careers in the skilled trades are seen as a default, Thuston said.

Apprenticeships are presented as a solution, but many do not have the basic skills to begin these programs.

""We've taken that problem away for the learner,"" Carlson said.

BERMO is the first company to house the program and graduate a class.

Longtime employees and new certificate holder Steve Anderson explains that ""You can still teach an old dog new tricks."" Anderson embodies the intention of the program.

According to the program website the goal is to help, ""Employers and unions fulfill the growing need for skilled advanced manufacturing production workers. The IMT is a nationally recognized apprenticeship registered with the U.S. Department of Labor that trains front-line manufacturing production workers in skills manufacturers.""

An IMT apprenticeship program is 18th months or 3,000 hours which often are in the same the some which amount to 2-3 hours of strenuous work in the classroom.

Help improve manufacturing processes and schedules to meet customer requirements;.

Understand manufacturing as a business system that integrates multiple disciplines, processes, and stakeholders;.

A self-described ""Jack of all trades""Anderson explained that the program serves as, ""Validation of the skills I actually have."" Entry level jobs are straightforward; however, with each promotion, the tasks become more complex.

Erson argues that with this sort of training and awareness, ""You can see something that maybe other folks didn't catch"" creating a safer and more productive work environment.

BERMO Plant Manager Tom Frister further explains that ""New hires have a lack of a skill set. these programs help alleviate that."" He explained, ""People are not born skilled.""

The funding comes from the federal Department of Labor American Apprenticeship Initiative grant.

""Jobs for the Future is excited to be one of the grant recipients, receiving $5 million to expand our partnership with the Working for America Institute of the AFL-CIO, Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, and four other local intermediary organizations to establish and promote the new Industrial Manufacturing Technicianhybrid apprenticeship model. The funds will also be used to create 1,450 industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeships across eight states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.""

""Hands-on apprenticeships, where workers earn and learn at the same time, are a proven path to good, secure middle-class jobs. In fact, 87 percent of apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $50,000. The return on investment for employers is also impressive - studies from around the globe suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity, reduced waste and greater front-line innovation.""

The IMT certificate program is designed to develop a pathway for shop floor workers to ascend into the available and needed higher skilled better-paying positions.

The program responds to a unique situation in our economy; a lowering unemployment rate coupled with stagnant wages.

Younger workers are also steering away from industrial and manufacturing work.

Frister explains that from a workforce perspective, ""The low unemployment rate means that you have to do things differently."" Industrial Manufacturing Technician Apprenticeship gives workers an opportunity to learn new skills and grow into available positions thus advancing careers and filling in workforce gaps.

Pine Technical and Community College Director of Workforce Development Heidi Braun-Kahn explained that the classes were specifically designed for the program through a 2012 federal advanced manufacturing grant.

The classes are adaptive responding to the reality that working adult have various obligations, for example, raising children, that present a barrier to pursue an advanced manufacturing certificate.

Instead, the courses are offered through interactive television, as Braun-Kahn describes, ""To bring the training to their workplace."" She also explains that many of these workers had never gone to college or hadn't been in quite some time.

Having these courses with co-workers at the workplace easies the tension of being forced to go to a community college campus.

Braun-Kahn notes that with renewed confidence workers often pursue college courses afterward.

"" Overall for Braun-Kahn, ""it has been a great partnership with the Minnesota AFL-CIO."".

Graduates Pedro Driscoll and Dan Gese describe themselves as lifelong learners therefore they enjoyed the experience and were excited to take advantage of it.

Aspects of the program were not met with enthusiasm.

For Driscoll, ""math was hard, haven't done it in many years.

IUE-CWA Local 1140 President Howard Terry explains that from the union's perspective the program encourages a better relationship with the employer, ""companies and unions are not always adversarial.

"" For Terry, the investment in employees through education, ""sparks new life.

"" For those reasons and others Terry, ""fully endorses the IMT certificate program.

While employers were hesitant at first to partner with unions on a workforce program the success at BERMO proves that the program works, demonstrating it's validity.

""We have to be very creative and very aggressive,"" Clark said.

In addition to its new apprenticeship program for high-schoolers and its long-standing Tech Scholars program, which currently trains, and bankrolls the education of, about 60 college-level apprentices, Michelin has started recruiting adult workers from other industries, such as hospitality.

Clark also described a pilot program in Columbia for ex-offenders.

History: Michelin brought jobs, major investment to Greenville in 1970s.

""We are working with a company that is beginning to retrain people who have had some issues with the law, let's say, but are reformed,"" Clark said, ""And we are giving them an opportunity to explore careers as well.""

Michelin has about 9,000 employees across South Carolina - the vast majority of whom are direct hires for the French tire maker.

Clark said his company is the largest manufacturing employer in the state.

Michelin North America Chairman and President Scott Clark signs 17-year-old Jacob Tucker's hiring papers for a first-of-its-kind high-school apprenticeship program that launched in Greenville this spring.

Sixteen-year-old Johnathan Harper, far left, is home-schooled and started his apprenticeship a month ago.

The high-school apprentice program takes teens who are midway through their junior year and has them continue to work at the plant through the end of their senior year.

Ideally, Clark said, students will go on to enroll in a mechatronics or related program at an area technical college, where they can take advantage of the free tuition and expenses offered through Michelin's Tech Scholars program.

He said he foresees doubling the Tech Scholars program in coming years.

""These students, if they get through this apprenticeship program with Michelin, and then can go to a two-year technical school, they can come out of school making $54,000, $55,000 a year,"" Clark said.

Scott Clark will take up the chairmanship and presidency of Michelin North America on Jan. 1, 2018.

The high school program is carried out under a provision that allows workers under the age of 18 to enter a plant so long as they are simultaneously enrolled in an academic program linked to the work.

Lynn Tuten, the work-based learning coordinator for Golden Strip Career Center, said she will be in touch with the boys regularly to make sure they are getting everything they need and are showing up to work on time, among other things.

All five teens are enrolled in a mechatronics course at Golden Strip.

Four of the five teens are Mauldin High School students, and the fifth - Johnathan Harper - is home-schooled.

Two of the young men started working at Michelin part-time about a month ago - earning $10 an hour for nine hours a week - and the others will start this summer, working full-time hours until school starts again in August.

""We build and repair parts in the factory; we get them working and back on the line,"" Harper said.

His mother, Terri Harper, has home-schooled her son all his life and said he might very well enroll at Greenville Tech and eventually get a four-year engineering degree.

""I think it's great that Michelin is working with the career center to give these kids a jumping off point. They work so hard,"" Harper said, adding that she liked the idea of her son landing on his feet career-wise.

US1's Crawford said that during his time as a site leader in the United Kingdom, he met many workers who had been with Michelin for more than 40 years - starting out as 16-year-old apprentices who worked their way up through manufacturing.

These included two plant managers and a man who is now the head of the technical team for North America.

""He's 64, and he's got 48 years with the company,"" Crawford said, pointing to the high school students seated next to him, ""And he stood right where where you are many years ago. It's phenomenal to see that.""

Michelin North America is an $11 billion company with plants across the U.S. and in Canada and Mexico.

Some of the biggest ones are in the Upstate: US1 at Donaldson, which makes car tires, opened in 1975, and Anderson County has plants making rubber and earth-moving-equipment tires."
242,Tribune News Report,3/10/2018 0:00,"Gov. Tom Wolf outlined his plans on Friday for PAsmart - a new workforce development initiative that helps connect Pennsylvanians with resources for working and training in Pennsylvania.

The governor made the announcement during a tour of New Century Careers, a Southwestern Pennsylvania workforce development organization.

""I am investing in the people of Pennsylvania by launching the PAsmart initiative, which will help Pennsylvanians get the skills they need to get good, middle class jobs,"" he said.

""Pennsylvanians have never shied away from hard work, pursuing education opportunities, and seeking out training. Through this initiative, Pennsylvania will have the most prepared, talented, and able workforce in the country. We're not working harder; we're working smarter.""

25 million increase in STEM and computer science education at all levels.

Nearly 300,000 jobs in the commonwealth require skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

Over the next decade, more than 70 percent of new jobs will require these skills.

7 million increase in apprenticeships with a goal of doubling the number of registered apprentices by 2025.

Since Governor Wolf established the commonwealth's first Apprenticeship and Training Office in 2016, the number of registered apprentices has increased 14.5 percent, from 13,282 registered apprentices to 15,208.

3 million increase for Industry Partnerships which bring together workers and multiple employers in the same industry in a public-private partnership to provide job training.

10 million increase to develop Career and Technical Education and STEM career pathways to help students learn about career options and earn an associate degree at a lower cost and in less time.

5 million increase to encourage employers to partner with colleges and universities to develop educational programs that prepare students for the jobs high demand jobs that local employers need.

As part of the first phase of the PASmart initiative, the Wolf administration is launching a new website dedicated to help people get information about pursing an education and career in Pennsylvania at any stage of life.

The workforce development initiatives support the governor's goal to increase the number of workers with postsecondary training from 47 percent today to 60 percent by 2025.

While on the tour at New Century Careers, the governor also announced that the organization has been approved as one of the first recipients of the new Pennsylvania Manufacturing Training-to-Career Grant Program.

""It's wonderful to see the incredible work being done here at New Century Careers, connecting people with the skills they need to get meaningful careers in the manufacturing industry - one of Pennsylvania's most critical industries,"" Wolf said.

""This kind of program is incredibly important and that's why we're recognizing and rewarding New Century as one of the first recipients of our new Pennsylvania Manufacturing Training-to-Career Grants in the amount of $150,000 to support its Manufacturing 2000 initiative.""

The Pennsylvania Manufacturing Training-to-Career Grant program to help companies identify and train a skilled workforce while creating a workplace culture that enables the workforce to advance and the company to grow.

Grants are provided to Pennsylvania manufacturers that partner with technical and trade schools, Pennsylvania's community colleges, and those non-profit organizations that demonstrate both experience and expertise in the development and deployment of workforce development programs.

The Pennsylvania Manufacturing Innovation Program leverages the internationally acclaimed science and engineering talent and discovery capacity of Pennsylvania's institutions of higher education to help ensure that the commonwealth remains an international leader in manufacturing.

This includes a Manufacturing Fellows program, designed to support designated undergraduate and graduate student Fellows in both long- and short-term engagements with industry.

Pennsylvania's Industrial Resource Centers are expanding their outreach to include small and medium-sized businesses, and will continue to provide technical, strategic, and market-based assistance to Pennsylvania's manufacturing sector.

New Century Careers is a Southwestern Pennsylvania workforce development organization with a dual client mission to support pre-employment and incumbent manufacturing workers as well as their current or future employers to help each set of clients advance economically through continuous workforce education and training."
243,Trevor Anderson,3/10/2018 6:00,"For several years, the Upstate?s manufacturing sector has been facing a talent crisis.  Economic growth, low unemployment, misconceptions about manufacturing, and baby boomers aging out of the workforce have made it difficult for firms to fill their rolls with future leaders.  A few companies have seized their own destiny and partnered with the region?s four-year and technical colleges to develop their own versions of the tried-and-true European apprenticeship model.  But Greenville-based Michelin North America is reaching even deeper into the well.

On Friday, March 9, the French tiremaker celebrated a milestone in its Michelin Youth Apprenticeship program, a partnership with Greenville County Schools (GCS).  Michelin held an event similar to signing days for high school and college athletes at the newly remodeled Enoree Career Center."
251,Lorraine Mirabella,3/12/2018 10:40,"Maryland gained nearly 13,000 jobs in January as the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1 percent, the U.S. Labor Department said Monday.

The number of jobs in Maryland increased to 2.73 million, with growth in construction, transportation and utilities, professional and business services, education and health services and leisure and hospitality, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The state lost jobs in the government and financial activities sectors and saw little change in manufacturing.

The state's jobless rate has remained at 4.1 percent since November.

Employment in Maryland mirrored the national trend, with the U.S. unemployment rate in January unchanged from the previous month at 4.1 percent.

Jobless rates were stable in 44 states, while unemployment fell in six states and Washington D.C. in January.

Maryland saw the strongest job growth in the professional and business services sector, with a gain of 6,700 jobs.

That included 4,200 jobs within the administrative and support and waste management remediation services sub-sector and 2,600 positions in the professional, scientific and technical services sub-sector.

Another 3,500 jobs were added in education and health services.

Mining, logging and construction grew by 2,300 jobs, and leisure and hospitality added 1,500 positions, the government data showed.

""A healthy economy begins with a healthy workforce,"" Maryland Labor Secretary Kelly M. Schulz said in an announcement.

Schulz said employees have benefited from training, education and support services offered through workforce development programs such as the Maryland Apprenticeship and Training Program.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reduced the state's estimated job loss in December to 11,000 jobs from the previously reported 20,200."
252,Libby Solomon,3/12/2018 11:12,"Latrice Scroggins, 26, said she has always had jobs - but never a career.

Then she found the Sisters in the Brotherhood Pre-Apprenticeship Program: an eight-week training program held at the Mid-Atlantic Carpenters' Training Center in Arbutus to prepare women for apprenticeships in carpentry.

Scroggins is one of five women in the training program whose purpose is to give women a leg up in the male-dominated trade.

The current session, which will wrap up at the end of March, is the second of its kind to be held at the Arbutus center.

Susan Schultz, the New Jersey-based head of the Eastern branch of Sisters in the Brotherhood, which supports female members of the union, directs the program.

""For the most part, most women don't grow up thinking 'OK, I want to be a carpenter,'"" Schultz said.

Lachaye Dudley, 30, said when she told her family and friends about the carpentry program, they were surprised.

""They were like, no! It's only men in there - is there gonna be other females around you?"" Dudley recalled.

Less than 2 percent of the carpentry union's members are women, Schultz estimated.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less than 10 percent of employees in the construction industry are women.

Boys often learn from the men in their family about carpentry or associated skills like welding, something Schultz said ""Doesn't happen with young girls becoming young women.""

To even the scales, Schultz said, the course in Arbutus trains women in basic carpentry skills: tools, safety regulations, job site culture, and even how to carry heavy materials on a construction site.

Dudley said that in class the women discussed the challenges of entering a job site with mostly men.

""The men, they will look at females like we can't do as much as them,"" Dudley said.

""Me, I'm gonna put in good work, make sure I put in the same amount of work as the men.""

Part of the impetus to get women into the field is that carpentry has a lot of benefits as a career, Schultz said.

Schultz said, carpentry is often a lifelong career.

""When I go to career fairs, sometimes people call them job fairs, but I don't like to use that term,"" said Tim Miller, director of the three Mid-Atlantic Training centers.

Dudley said she and some of the other women plan to work toward careers as pile drivers, driving piling into the earth to set up the foundation for buildings and bridges.

""We're dedicated to these women,"" Schultz said, adding that the union maintains relationships with trainees after they graduate, offering continued training and support.

Ingrid Ross, 52, said that the program's focus on women appealed to her.

""When it said it's for women, it really sparked me to join,"" she said, ""Because it's a male-dominated field.""

Ross, of Upper Marlboro, was formerly a chef, but decided to ""Reinvent myself into something different."" She said carpentry appealed to her because she enjoys building and fixing things around the house.

For Ross, learning to weld was the biggest challenge.

""The women come in here and don't think they can do trigonometry, until they put it to carpenter terms. As an instructor, you can kind of see the light come on.""

Dudley said she left her office job as a medical assistant for carpentry because the physical nature of the work ""Fit my personality."" Strong and athletic, Dudley's nickname among the trainees is ""Muscles.""

Four weeks in, Dudley's favorite part of the program was welding.

The training center has eight welding booths for trainees to practice arc welding metal plates together.

While welding, the trainees wore leather gloves and protective helmets emblazoned with each of their nicknames; Ross is ""Mama Dearest,"" Scroggins is ""Dance Hall,"" and Evans is ""Queen Mother.""

To train beginning welders, the center also has a $45,000 virtual reality system that simulates the process of welding.

The women have the opportunity to become certified welders.

In one class, instructor Denny Blake showed the women plates the center keeps after certification tests.

To become certified, he said, applicants weld together metal plates, and then the tester bends them into a U shape.

If the weld is secure, it will hold together, and if not, it will splinter.

""I'm gonna do everything I can to break your weld,"" Blake told them.

""But if you weld correctly, they'll bend like butter.""

Dudley compared the finicky, detailed process of welding to cake decorating.

""I had never even heard of welding,"" Dudley said, nor had she planned on becoming a carpenter.

Schultz compared the eight-week session to a boot camp, saying it is a way for women to learn whether carpentry suits them.

Four weeks in, some of the women at the training session said they had found their calling."

254,Staff,3/12/2018 16:39,"Students pondering what to do with their lives, along with those in the workforce looking to boost their skills and desirability with employers, would do well to turn their attention to the field of cybersecurity where there is a dearth of qualified professionals.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the need for information security analysts is estimated to grow 28 percent through 2026, much faster than other occupations.

CyberSeek, an interactive cybersecurity jobs heat map funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, estimates there are more than 285,000 job openings in the field.

CyberVirginia reported last year more than 36,000 cybersecurity jobs needed to be filled in Virginia, which by the way, also has the most cybersecurity companies per capita in the nation.

The good news for Hampton Roads residents hoping to fill those positions is that there are plenty of local places to get an education in the field including Regent University, Tidewater Community College, Thomas Nelson Community College and Old Dominion University.

Hongyi ""Michael"" Wu, professor of electrical and computer engineering at ODU and director of the university's Center for Cybersecurity, Education & Research, said there are more than 3,000 cybersecurity openings in Hampton Roads.

""There is a very high demand for cybersecurity professionals. When we talk with managers - in the Navy, the government - everyone talks about how difficult it is to hire qualified security people. It's in all sectors of business, government, the military and the medical sector,"" he said.

Wu said students graduating with a degree in cybersecurity can expect an annual salary of $80,000.

""It's very well-paying because there are so many positions and a very small pool of qualified candidates,"" he said.

Many of the positions posted on internet job boards are rather vague, with titles like cybersecurity analyst.

Within areas of expertise such as networking, software development, systems engineering, risk analysis and security intelligence, specific job titles include cybersecurity investigator, incident responder, penetration/vulnerability tester, and my favorite, certified ethical hacker.

Wu said that to address the dire need for cybersecurity professionals, many companies provide incentives for employees to get an advanced degree in the field, often covering tuition.

In an email, Joseph Campbell with Booz Allen Hamilton, said the management and technology consulting and engineering company offers employees tuition assistance for degree programs and professional certifications and education discounts.

Employees and their family members can take advantage of a 10 percent tuition discount on a master's of engineering in cybersecurity policy and compliance,"" he stated.

""We also created a learning lab at Booz Allen's training headquarters"" in McLean, Va. One of the problems with filling the vacancies is there is a need for professionals with between five and 10 years of experience.

William Clement, dean of information technology and business at TCC, said educational institutions are working to address that problem by developing programs that place students in an immersive learning environment to give them the hands-on skills they need to get hired.

One example of that he said is a $642,000 grant for the creation of the Hampton Roads Cyber Collaboration Laboratory awarded by GO Virginia, a business-led, state-wide initiative to foster private sector job growth and a high-tech workforce.

Work at the lab focuses on innovation in cybersecurity, data analytics, autonomous vehicles and virtual technologies markets in Hampton Roads.

The grant proposal was coordinated by ODU and is operated through the university's Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center.

Clement said the creation of digital internships is another part of the grant to help students get real life experience.

""In any internship, if somebody can get in the door there's a better chance of getting hired because you become a known quantity and that's part of what HRCyber Co-Lab is doing,"" Clement said.

Apprenticeships that offer experience and hands-on skills, once thought of more for skilled workers such as welders, are another way to combat the shortage of cybersecurity professionals.

""We were the first to start a cyber apprenticeship, with Peregrine Solutions which was the first company registered with the Virginia Department of Labor as a cyber apprentice,"" he said.

""It's an investment and commitment for a company to bring someone on full time. Unlike an internship, which is for a finite period, an apprenticeship requires the company to hire the employee for a year.""

""What I'm seeing are students interested in this area because it is a hot area getting that is getting a lot of publicity and exposure,"" Clement said, adding TCC and ODU entered an agreement through which TCC students move on to ODU after earning their two-year degree."

As a recent graduate of Lincoln High School in Manitowoc, former Youth Apprentice Eddie Gilmer split his time between high school academics, vocational instruction at Lakeshore Technical College and paid job training at LDI Industries.

The program enabled Eddie to adjust his school schedule for a few hours each morning to work with a company mentor who taught him how to use tools and machines to precisely measure, cut and bore metal.

Eddie says that staff at LDI Industries were very accepting, supportive and helpful, ""They want to teach you.

257,Staff,3/13/2018 5:30,"Apprenticeship in the health care industry, specifically for MAs, has been proven as a successful solution for growing and retaining talent.

The Benefits and Costs of Apprenticeships: A Business Perspective report highlights the benefits of such a program implemented at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. One cause for hesitation, voiced by some employers considering apprenticeship, is the initial investment in launching a program.

According to the report, the average cost of the program was $59,700 per apprentice.

Of this cost, 70 percent accounted for wages and benefits, which would likewise be paid to an experienced, nonapprentice hire.

Classroom training accounted for 15 percent of the investment.

This breakdown might imply that the cost of hiring an apprentice exceeds that of hiring an experienced MA there are a few key issues to consider.

In most cases, it is difficult to find experienced MAs to hire.

To overcome the challenge of finding ready-made talent, Dartmouth-Hitchcock paid overtime to its providers to do MA-level work, costing an estimated $24 additional per hour in labor costs over the average MA apprentice wage.

Implementing the program also reduced physician turnover, in this case, and likely for other health care organizations, by creating more balanced teams and a greater ability to schedule procedures and medications.

Replacing a physician costs $250,000, or about the cost of training four apprentices, which Dartmouth-Hitchcock has not had to do since implementing the program.

Dartmouth-Hitchcock also has been able to significantly increase the number of booked hours.

Given the level of benefits in the program, the report estimated the program more than paid for itself, even when accounting for wages and benefits, by its third cohort."

271,George Ryan,3/15/2018 6:14,"Ask anyone to name a gold-standard apprenticeship system and, chances are, a few familiar countries will crop up.

Germany would likely be there, where half of young people complete some form of apprenticeship training.

Maybe Switzerland, whose economy regularly tops global competiveness tables, thanks largely to its skilled workforce.

Or perhaps Finland, whose apprenticeships model particularly helps adults retrain or upskill.

Despite the criticism the apprenticeship and skills system in the UK has faced, it seems governments across the world - from the US to France and China - are now also looking to Britain with its reformed apprenticeship system for ideas on how to kick-start their own skills revolution.

The skills sector lags behind compared to other parts of the education system in terms of its export value.

The latest figures show that further education exports account for only 2 per cent of the UK's total educational exports - a figure that fell by almost two thirds in the five years to 2015.

FE is dwarfed by higher education, which accounts for 67 per cent of the total.

The burgeoning international appetite for apprenticeships could therefore be an opportunity for the sector to increase its export potential.

In November 2016, then US president Barack Obama signed a proclamation declaring the first National Apprenticeships Week in the USA. The idea was reportedly borrowed from the UK, after a trip by former secretary of labour Tom Perez to London, which fell during the UK's National Apprenticeship Week.

Perez was apparently so impressed with the idea, he told Obama that the US should have its own.

""It was a British idea they have stolen from us,"" says Tom Bewick, who accompanied the secretary on the trip.

An advisor to the last Labour government on industrial training policy, Bewick went on to advise the US Department of Labor on apprenticeships.

Bewick founded the Transatlantic Apprenticeship Exchange Forum in 2015, which works with just shy of a dozen UK training providers, helping them export elements of their apprenticeships provision.

""You have to step out of your own system to evaluate it and see both its strengths and its weaknesses,"" Bewick says.

Despite apprenticeships going through a ""Challenging time"" with the introduction of the levy last April and the subsequent dramatic fall in apprenticeship starts, he believes Britain is still well-placed to achieve a high percentage of young people taking the ""Learn and earn"" route.

He said degree apprenticeships were going to be the ""Sweet spot"" for the American market, because having a degree is ""Even more pervasive over here,"" Bewick adds.

Last June, Donald Trump signed an executive order doubling the budget for apprenticeship grants to $200m, later approved by Congress.

His administration also announced a ""Moonshot goal"" of achieving 5 million apprenticeships, only 2 million more than the UK government's own target on starts by 2020.

With a workforce five times as large as Britain's, this is a perhaps less of a ""Moonshot"" than it first appears.

In the US, apprentices make up only 0.2 per cent of the workforce, compared to nearly 3 per cent in the UK. But this is still dwarfed by Germany and many other countries in the rest of Europe.

It is Britain's flexible labour market and its proliferation of independent training providers, or ""Intermediary workforce players"" as they are known in US, which makes the UK more attractive in some respects than Germany, Bewick says.

""The UK sector does not realise the expertise they have which is ripe for exporting, whether its end-point assessments or e-portfolios, which could be exported abroad, particularly as businesses in the US are used to buying in 'business solutions'"".

It is not just America which is looking to the UK's apprenticeships system.

In 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Education chose Britain as a country to emulate as part of an apprenticeships piloting programme.

This included a college in Shanghai using UK apprenticeship frameworks and curriculums.

On a recent visit to Shanghai as part of preparation for the 2021 WorldSkills competition, Dr Neil Bentley, chief executive of WorldSkills UK, says it was clear from conversations with officials that China is very interested in learning from the UK's education and training system.

""This is particularly around our apprenticeship standards but also crucially how we encourage and enable creative approaches to thinking across all industries,"" he adds.

Euan Blair, chief executive of WhiteHat - a tech start-up that helps link young people to find apprenticeship opportunities - says a number of countries are looking at the UK model and exploring launching something similar.

""We work with a range of international companies who are keen to explore how to expand apprenticeship programmes they've launched on the back of the levy to other countries. We're currently working on a new apprenticeship scheme that would see apprentices spend six months of their programme in California and six months in London,"" he says.

Blair adds: ""We've been in regular contact with the French Embassy - and a delegation of government officials from Belgium is attending a roundtable at our offices next month."" He adds that countries as wide ranging as South Africa and Malaysia are exploring how to use apprenticeships more effectively.

Apprenticeships and skills minister Anne Milton says that it is ""Great to hear that other countries are inspired by the fantastic apprenticeships on offer here in England"".

""We have changed apprenticeships so they are flexible, high quality and led by the demands of industry - and I have seen the positive impact this has on apprentices and employers across the country.""

""Apprenticeships are not only giving employers the skills they need to grow, they are also giving people a real alternative to traditional academic study so they can benefit from the excellent career prospects that they offer."""
272,Paul Farley,3/15/2018 7:35,"As it celebrated National Apprenticeship Week earlier this month, Parker Knoll announced that it had expanded its longstanding apprenticeship scheme to include both frame assembly and business administration, in addition to traditional upholstery.

With 149 years of furnituremaking experience, the brand offers an extensive apprenticeship programme, giving young people the chance to develop traditional artisan skills in upholstery and classic furniture design, as well as marketing and production.

The addition of these new roles reflects an increased demand for apprenticeships in the sector, as well as demonstrating the value they hold for businesses that offer them.

Each Parker Knoll apprenticeship lasts for approximately 22 months, and trainees are paid for the duration, enabling them to start earning a wage whilst gaining a practical education.

Now in its 11th year, National Apprenticeship Week is an annual celebration of all apprentices across the country, and the businesses that offer them key training and career development."
274,John Cropley/Gazette Business,3/15/2018 17:20,"COLONIE - Capital Region manufacturers having trouble finding skilled workers can now get help through a new apprenticeship program.

The Center for Economic Growth is partnering with the Manufacturers Association of New York on the initiative to help companies train new workers.

At too many companies, organizers say, the manufacturing workforce is aging, and there are not enough young workers with the skills or inclination to replace them.

The Manufacturing Intermediary Apprenticeship Program provides help with a lot of the paperwork and red tape involved with training.

The costs in many cases are still borne by the companies themselves, but they are not huge - sometimes only $3,000 per employee.

CEG, the economic development agency serving the eight-county Capital Region, held an informational session about the program Tuesday.

CEG President Andrew Kennedy said apprenticeships are a good path to careers - not just jobs - for people who don't want to attend a two- or four-year college.

""Much has been talked about; hopefully it's coming across: There really is no one solution for manufacturing issues,"" he said.

The apprenticeship program is just one piece of the puzzle to attract companies to the region, help existing companies stay and grow, convince young people to stay in the area and attract new young people to the area.

Martha Ponge, director of apprenticeship for the Manufacturers Association of Central New York, said the ability for a company to grow ""Really depends on them having a well-trained workforce.""

She noted that 95 percent of New York manufacturers are small or medium-sized, with one to 100 employees.

There are fewer huge manufacturers in New York than there once were, but there is a vibrant community of smaller manufacturers.

She said the Capital Region is adding manufacturing jobs at a faster pace than many areas, so it needs more of the workers who are in short supply.

""You're growing much more quickly in the Capital District than a lot of other places in the state, and so the challenges are going to get exponentially larger as you try and grow as a manufacturing community.""

Patrisia Sheremeta, human resources manager for Greno Industries in Glenville, said her company has a hard time growing its workforce of 40.

""I just placed an ad for an experienced machinist and I got zero applicants,"" she said.

""I think the demand for machinists is high and the number of people with the skills is low.""

Greno machines parts for turbine applications and is trying to grow its own workforce, she said at Tuesday's meeting, including through YouthBuild, BOCES, and, now, the apprenticeship program.

""We're very involved in this program; we're very excited about it,"" Sheremeta said.

Maribeth Kehrer, human resources coordinator for Velocity Print in Scotia, said her printing company employs about 75.

Roughy 60 percent of them are in production, and many are getting closer to retirement.

""We're just looking for people who have some kind of mechanical inclination,"" Kehrer said.

""The printing industry requires a lot of technical training, so it takes time to train the workers themselves.""

There's a misconception that print is a dying industry, she added, so it's especially helpful for a printer to have an apprenticeship program.

""I think it gives us a pipeline to people who are looking to make a career I think that's the biggest thing: finding somebody who's not just looking for a job but a career.""

Two local community colleges are involved in the initiative.

Hudson Valley Community College's new Manufacturing Technology Pathways Project, which gives training through stackable non-credit courses that prepare students for work, is seen as an ideal prelude to apprenticeship.

Associate Dean Penny Hill called it just the latest step in workforce training for the school, which founded its Advanced Manufacturing Technology program 60 years ago.

Denise Zieske, vice president of workforce development and community education at Schenectady County Community College, said SCCC is launching a certified production technician program that will help further the goals of the apprenticeship program.

It is designed to provide universal skills, such as safety, quality practices and measurement and maintenance awareness, rather than specific skills for specific jobs, but SCCC has fine-tuned classroom work to match the needs of partner companies or industries, such as craft brewing.

""What we're doing in the class is ever-evolving and changing,"" Zieske said.

""I think that's what we're looking to do for the manufacturers."""
279,Dan O'Brien,3/16/2018 5:45,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - For the past year, the Greater Oh-Penn Apprenticeship Network's programs have helped participating employers in the manufacturing sector mostly train and enhance the skills of in-house employees.

These employers have found that elevating the skills of existing workers isn't enough to secure a qualified workforce in today's tight labor market.

""We're seeing a shift from companies training internally to looking outside of industry,"" said Jessica Borza, executive director of the Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition, a partner in the Oh-Penn Network.

While companies interested in procuring talent through apprenticeships prefer those who have some training or exposure through trade or technical schools, more are willing to take the risk and invite others who may not have any mechanical or industrial experience.

""Now, employers are asking us to give them people who have a good work history - even if it's in a different industry - and we'll invest in them,"" Borza said.

That's the trust behind an effort to expand the Oh-Penn Apprenticeship Network in the Mahoning Valley through new programs administered through Eastern Gateway Community College and career centers in Trumbull and Columbiana counties.

Beginning this fall, the program will add machining apprenticeship programs to EGCC's machining lab at Choffin Career Center in Youngstown, and Columbiana County Career and Technical Center's training lab in Lisbon.

Trumbull County Career and Technical Center in Champion is currently administering a machining apprenticeship program sponsored by Oh-Penn.

Aside from the three machining programs, a new welder/fitter apprenticeship course will be added through EGCC, and an industrial maintenance program will be introduced at TCCTC, Borza said.

The goal is to fill all five programs this fall with 12 apprentices each for a total of about 60 participants, Borza said.

Thus far, 16 manufacturers have signed on with the initiative, she said.

With the labor market so tight, it's becoming more difficult for manufacturers to find qualified workers to staff positions as older employees retire, Borza said.

The apprenticeship programs have helped advance the skills of existing employees, but there needs to be more skilled workers to fill projected vacancies in the machining, industrial maintenance and welding/fitting trades.

It's forced companies to reach out to the general public to recruit new employees interested in a career in manufacturing, which can be a risky investment for some companies, acknowledged Ryan Pasco, director of engineering at EGCC. ""We're finding that companies are willing to take the risk because they are having a hard time filling positions,"" he said.

To help this process along, MVMC has scheduled two recruitment fairs this spring, Borza said.

The first is scheduled for April 26 at CCCTC and the second is slated for May 3 at Choffin.

In general, it should take three years for an entry-level apprentice with little experience to complete the program, Borza said.

The first two years would be devoted to a combination of on-the-job training and classwork, while the third year is.

Those who already possess specific skills and aptitudes can test out for certifications, and bypass some of the curricula, Borza said, and shorten the time it takes to complete training.

Pasco said that apprenticeship programs are especially valuable for those who want to pursue an education while working full-time.

The tech courses completed would translate into credit hours toward an associate's degree at EGCC, he said.

""This allows them to earn a living, upgrade their skills, advance their careers and pursue and education,"" Pasco said.

Under the program, the host employer pays the apprentice.

Entry-level apprentices can earn between $14 and $16 an hour, depending on the nature of work, the employee's skill level and the company, Borza said.

Those companies that participate in Oh-Penn's apprenticeship program would receive reimbursements for the training, Borza noted.

For the first two years of the program, Oh-Penn would reimburse companies $5,000 per apprentice.

Since the program is already a year old, those companies new to the apprenticeship network would still qualify for the $5,000 reimbursement for the fall courses, she said.

The MVMC has made it easy for companies to get on board with the program, Borza noted.

""They just need to identify the apprentice, identify a mentor or mentors, pay for classroom training which will be reimbursed, and then keep track of their progression on the job,"" she said.

The apprenticeships are funded through a $2.9 million U.S. Dept.

Of Labor grant, which the organization secured two years ago.

Pasco added that while some companies are hesitant to invest in new training programs for fear their employees might leave for another job once their training is completed, new studies show that such programs have the opposite effect.

""Current employees feel more appreciated, and creates an allegiance to keep them there,"" he said, thus boosting retention among an employer.

Borza noted the labor pool isn't expanding anytime soon.

""The reality is that the pool is shrinking, and those coming into the schools isn't going to be enough to fill the pipeline for the future,"" she said.

""The forecast should be enough to convince them.""

290,Ed Central,3/19/2018 7:37,"Eighty-three percent of respondents supported increased government funding to support apprenticeship.

Apprenticeship is a rare area of bipartisan agreement.

Governors from both parties have worked to increase the number and diversity of apprenticeship programs.

On Capitol Hill, there are bipartisan bills aimed at strengthening apprenticeship.

The current administration and the last administration agree on little else, but both have endorsed apprenticeship.

Even with clear political support, no one had asked what the American public thinks about apprenticeship.

To close that gap, New America worked with Lake Research to survey over a thousand people on how they perceived these programs.

What we found was what politicians already seem to know: apprenticeship enjoys significant bipartisan support.

Not only that, Americans agree apprenticeship should have additional government funding.

That's about the same percentage of Americans that admire scientists and firefighters.

Ninety-three percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans favor additional spending on these programs.

A majority of respondents also believe that apprenticeship is the best way to prepare for a career.

When asked what they would recommend to a child in their life who was considering what to do after high school, only a quarter said they would recommend apprenticeship while almost half said they would recommend a four-year college.

There is a disconnect between what Americans think is good for other people and what they believe is good for those closest to them.

We suspected people had a certain picture in their mind when they heard the term apprenticeship.

A picture of blue collar jobs, something other than college, that would not facilitate career progression for students who chose that path.

To do this, we conducted focus groups in Charlotte and Denver.

In these focus groups, it became clear that while older people associated apprenticeship with blue collar jobs, younger people associated it with people in business suits.

Parents and students were much more likely to embrace apprenticeship if there was a clear connection to and through higher education.

They liked that apprenticeship offered experience and hands on learning.

They liked that it was a postsecondary experience that was affordable and relevant to the job market.

They wanted to know that it would open more options not limit them.

That is why they were focused on being able to build on the experience over time.

Because of this focus, the issues that caused concern included ""Credits may not transfer,"" or ""The number and type of fields were too narrow.""

These findings reinforced our belief that, for apprenticeship to expand beyond a relatively narrow set of occupations, it must be more tightly connected to the higher education system.

Congress should create a special class of student who is also an apprentice and a special class of postsecondary academic degree that includes the core features of apprenticeship.

Congress can then include these definitions in relevant legislation and data sets throughout the federal government.

This will allow us create policy to support and scale these types of programs.

Congress should also develop a process for expanding the definition of ""Registration Agency"" to include state education agencies that meet a set of established criteria.

Those criteria should include formal recognition from the U.S. Secretary of Labor, demonstrated capacity to verify the standards of apprenticeship laid out in the National Apprenticeship Act, and demonstrated capacity to collect and report performance data on apprentices and apprenticeship programs.

To finance expanded apprenticeships, Congress should create an annual discretionary grant program, possibly using H-1B Visa funds, to support the development of Degree Apprenticeship programs.

Grants would fund partnerships among employers and/or industry associations, institutions of higher education, and other intermediaries.

They should expand and reform the Federal Work-Study program to allow funds to cover the tuition and fees of ""Student-apprentices"".

Americans believe apprenticeship deserves more government support.

They believe that it does an effective job preparing people for the labor market.

With some policy change, we can begin to scale it and connect it to higher education.

This will make apprenticeship an accepted way to gain a postsecondary education but without the debt or the uncertainty about job prospects upon completion."
291,Staff,3/19/2018 10:56,"Zach Fredenburg, far right, poses with students from his BOCES Auto Tech class, which will gain space to work on hybrid and electric vehicles in a capital project at the Adirondack Education Center in Saranac Lake.

In upcoming issues, the Enterprise will examine barriers to training and what nonprofits, government entities and educational institutions are doing about it.

SARANAC LAKE - There just aren't enough workers to fill the jobs.

From entry-level service workers to highly trained technicians, employers in the Adirondacks are finding that a lack of workers is slowing down everything from hotel openings to moving elderly patients from hospital rooms to their homes.

The labor shortage exists across the United States, but it is notably acute here.

""If I was doing this job in Houston, I'd be done by now,"" said Calli Shelton, looking at the bare floorboards of the old Dew Drop Inn in downtown Saranac Lake.

She and her husband Randy lived for many years in Texas.

They have started renovating the restaurant-bar space into what they hope will be a multi-purpose restaurant space.

Not only will the completed project offer high-end apartments looking over the Saranac River, an event space and a restaurant, but Shelton plans to host a cooking school at water level below the restaurant.

The school would help with the labor shortage, training students in the hospitality industry, but first they've got to get it built.

Shelton said the company in charge of renovations is having problems finding construction workers.

A block away, the Hotel Saranac faced the same issue in the months before it opened Jan. 18.

Not only did construction struggle with a finite number of workers to run electrical wiring and lay carpet, but staffing the hotel and its restaurant, bars, gift shop, salon and spa was a challenge.

Then-General Manager Michael Salyers told the Enterprise in December, ""We've held two job fairs. We're just not finding the people.""

According to a report published by the New York Association of Training & Employment Professionals, ""New York's economy is reaching its lowest unemployment rates in nearly a decade. The focus of workforce programs is shifting from re-employment services to assisting employers as they confront significant labor shortages in demand occupations and sectors.""

The North Country's labor gap is particularly affected by two factors: population decline and low rates of education.

NYATEP reports that among New York regions, the North Country had the second-greatest population decline, 7.4 percent, after the Southern Tier's 7.5 percent.

""It's a little bit of a chicken-egg thing,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said while visiting Plattsburgh on Jan. 31.

""There are a lot of people if there are a lot of jobs."" Like many people spoken to for this article, the governor suspects solving the jobs problem may solve the population decline.

After New York City, the North Country and the Hudson Valley had the highest number of workers with less than a high school diploma: 12 percent.

The North Country has more workers with just a high school diploma than any other region, 37 percent, and the fewest with a bachelor's degree or higher: 20 percent.

Labor analysts say many employers are begging for people with ""Middle skills"" - more education than a high school diploma and less than a college degree.

At the same time, vocational programs that used to be offered in high school are declining.

Alan Smith is director of the apprenticeship program for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The Electrical Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee runs a five-year program to certify journeyman electricians.

Each year, it takes the top scorers on an aptitude test and wait-lists the rest.

Apprentices work alongside electricians and attend classes two nights a week.

They are paid for their work, and the classes are free.

Smith said there's a lot of demand for the program, which only accepts a few dozen applicants a year.

On the Plattsburgh side of the IBEW district, ""About 75"" people are on the waitlist.

On the Watertown side, there are ""About 200."".

""With the Regents program requirements in high school, they don't have time to do shop class,"" said Smith.

Many IBEW apprentices come in lacking skills that were common a decade ago.

""Ten years ago, when we took in apprentices, we didn't worry about them needing to learn to read a tape measure. Now we know we have to. It's the first thing we teach them.""

""People expect to just hire carpenters off the street, but you just can't expect that anymore,"" said Smith.

""We feel that everybody should be doing what we're doing. If you want a skilled workforce, you have to invest in training. Our members put in somewhere around 3 percent of their wages toward the apprentices."""
294,Clint Cole,3/19/2018 16:52,"First Daughter, Ivanka Trump is on the road right now, promoting President Donald Trump's infrastructure plan.

On Monday morning, she accompanied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and visited the Waukee Innovation and Learning Center to learn about the Waukee APEX Program's approach to skills training and preparing students for the workforce.

The event included a tour of the WILC, which began at 9 a.m., followed by a round-table discussion, beginning at about 10:10 a.m. Trump left the WILC at about 11 a.m. ""Over the past year, Gov. Reynolds and I have worked closely on a number of workforce development initiatives,"" Trump said in a news release ahead of the visit.

""Gov. Reynolds serves on the Task Force for Apprenticeship Expansion and remains an important voice in discussions to increase K-12 STEM and computer science education nationwide. I applaud Gov. Reynolds' efforts to address this gap and commend her ongoing commitment to workforce development through programs such as the Waukee Innovation and Learning Center.""

Reynolds said she met with Trump when last she was in Washington and showed her screen shots of what the APEX program was doing.

""I was trying to entice her to come see in person the great things that are happening here in Iowa,"" Reynolds said after the visit.

""And she was not disappointed. She was really impressed with what she was able to see.""

Michelle Hill, director of the APEX program, said it was an honor to host Trump and have the APEX program showcased on a national level.

""It's always a great opportunity, or great day, when our students and our business partners get to showcase what they're doing,"" Hill said.

""Part of our mission is to help this type of learning scale across the state and nation, so we're happy for that opportunity today.""

Hill said that she had known about Trump's visit for about two weeks, although it was only officially announced on Friday, March 16, three days before she was set to arrive.

The students in the program got a chance to showcase what they have been working on, giving demonstrations and discussing their projects with Trump as she toured the building.

Seniors Claire Baudler and Ella Titus were two of the students involved.

Baudler said that the expansion of APEX to other schools and areas is something that is very important to a lot of people.

""Being able to have such a vital person who is so high up in the government be able to hear our experiences and take personal interest in it was really important,"" Baudler said.

Titus and Baudler hope that Trump learned a little about how important out-of-the-box learning is and can help formulate ways to expand the program.

""There can be a lot more to education than just classroom learning and that can help students in really profound ways to discover what they want to do with their lives and their careers,"" Baudler said.

The students were on spring break the week before the visit and didn't have a chance for special preparation, but Hill said that wasn't a problem since they are preparing for potential high-profile meetings from Day 1 in the program.

""We tell them part of your business dress, part of your handshake, part of being able to have a conversation with someone, look them in the eye,"" Hill said.

""All of that is preparation for a day like today.""

""We always tell them 'you never know who's going to be in the building.'"".

Hill said that the students did ""Amazing"" in their interactions with Trump.

Hill went on to say that it was energizing to hear how many people are interested in learning more about the APEX program and share a common goal with her of helping scale the program.

""Hearing that every single person at that round-table has that same mission is just super exciting,"" Hill said.

""I think how engaged she was and how interested in hearing from the students and interacting, it was just exciting to see the students get to show off a little bit.""

Hill said that one takeaway she wanted Trump to take back to Washington with her was that you don't need a state-of-the-art facility like the WILC to start a program like the Waukee APEX program.

She stated that you need one ""Incredible instructor"" that's ready to start the program, one engaged business partner and one student.

""This can be done in rural communities, it can be done anywhere,"" Hill said.

""I think she really heard that and was impressed that we support all students. We have no requirements to join.""

Reynolds said that she would like to see flexibility provided to states so they can be innovative and think outside the box and that's something she hopes Trump will take back to Washington with her.

""Really, the partnerships, I wanted her to see all the stakeholders that were involved from education to the government and providing some funding ideas to our business partners and how all of those are really important to make those work,"" Reynolds said.

""And I think she got a pretty good sense of that."""

With an ""Earn while you learn model"" of education and workforce development, Ask Franklin breaks down barriers, fast-tracks careers, and accommodates paths beyond traditional education, to allow students through an apprenticeship to earn a solid income, without debt.

At the same time, the new portal allows employers to garner a higher return over time and secure a pipeline of top talent.

""We are excited about releasing our public beta launch of the first apprenticeship recruitment portal in the U.S. because clearly, the rules have changed - college alone is not the only path to success, and college debt definitely does not have to be part of a student's financial future,"" said Kimberly Nichols, CEO and Co-Founder at Franklin Apprenticeships.

""Essentially, by accessing the features of the portal, both employers and individuals can challenge the status quo to create a more profitable future for all involved. We have plans for the official product launch later this year. By releasing our beta version, we can gather feedback, and gain awareness.""

Already employers across the globe are facing the most acute talent shortage since the recession in 2007.

According to Manpower Group, of the more than 42,000 employers surveyed, 40 percent said they are experiencing difficulty filling roles.

Many young adults have skills that can be developed through apprenticeships to fill these roles in such fields as IT, Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing, Logistics and Professional Services.

308,Dee DePass Star Tribune,3/20/2018 18:33,"Agco is launching an apprenticeship program at its Jackson, Minn., tractor manufacturing plant to train and recruit badly needed electrical mechanics and welders.

The program, fueled in part by state incentives, will start with four apprentices and grow to 20, officials said.

Some of those hired will be trained to program or repair the company's large, high-tech and customized agricultural machinery.

Others will be trained to work on many of the robotic assembly systems that help build Agco's massive and complex farm vehicles.

Officials from Agco and the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry kick off the new program Wednesday at a ceremony in Jackson.

The state will pay Agco $5,000 for each apprentice the Georgia-based manufacturer hires in Minnesota.

The $5,000 payments are part of a larger Minnesota Apprenticeship Initiative, which is co-developed by DLI and by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.

The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Officials said the goal is to help at least 100 Minnesota employers recruit, train and retain 1,000 new apprentices in the fields of advanced manufacturing, agriculture, health care, information technology and transportation.

The program is growing and now includes companies such as Uponor North America in Apple Valley; Viracon building glass maker in Owatonna; Mechanical Systems Inc. in Dundas; Owens Corning asphalt/roofing factory in Minneapolis; and K&G Manufacturing in Faribault.

John Aiken, the DLI's director of apprenticeship and labor standards, said the state hopes to bring to these and other companies the types of successful apprenticeship programs that exist in the construction field.

""It drives employment,"" fills employer vacancies and gives workers skills that last a lifetime, Aiken said.

By working with the state, Agco will get help designing its apprenticeship program.

The goal is to make sure workers in training get the specific skills and job-related instruction that the company needs.

DLI Commissioner Ken Peterson noted that such partnerships are particularly important now, when it's hard to find skilled workers, especially in rural communities.

Agco sits amid cornfields and a winding river in southwest Minnesota.

The Jackson area has a surprising array of industries but is often so starved for workers that it plucks candidates living 80 to 90 miles away.

Agco scrambles to find manufacturing talent along with Toro in Windom and Polaris Industries in Spirit Lake, Iowa.

Adding the apprenticeship program is one more tool that should help attract and retain workers, state and company officials said.

""In all skilled occupations across Minnesota, employers are seeking solutions to train new and existing workers for today's more technical jobs,"" Peterson said.

311,Staff,3/21/2018 10:33,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - The Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition and the Greater Oh-Penn Manufacturing Apprenticeship Network will co-host two apprentice recruiting fairs in April and May. The first fair will be held April 26 at the Columbiana County Career and Technical Center in Lisbon, while the second will be May 3 at the Choffin Career and Tehcnical Center in Youngstown.

All companies at the fairs are looking to hire full-time workers for their apprenticeship programs.

""Companies are looking for candidates with employment history and a willingness to learn,"" said Jessica Borza, the manufacturing coalition's executive director, in a release.

""This is a significant shift where manufacturers are willing to invest in candidates who have demonstrated dependability in unrelated jobs that may not offer the advancement opportunities and related pay and benefits.""

Through a $2.9 million grant from the Department of Labor's American Apprenticeship Initiative, the manufacturers coalition and Oh-Penn have worked with employers and educators in the region to develop apprenticeship program.

315,Amy Neff Roth,3/21/2018 20:00,"Hundreds of area youth are learning job skills and earning income without spending thousands on a college education.

Apprenticeships are alive and well, and poised to expand from traditional fields into high-tech areas.

Local unions run free apprenticeships in a wide range of trades, including electricians, sprinkler fitters, painters, elevator constructors, bricklayers and boilermakers.

Now the Workforce Development Board of Herkimer, Madison and Oneida Counties is offering grants to help area employers meet the demand for skilled workers by offering apprenticeships.

So far most of the takers have been advanced manufacturing firms, said Nate Crossett, program director of the board's American Apprenticeship Initiative.

""The major issue is that people, especially in manufacturing, are retiring at a rate that these local companies just can't keep up with,"" he said.

""Apprenticeships were a big deal in the '70s and '80s."".

Then came the push to send students to college and the apprenticeship programs declined, leaving no one with the needed skill sets to replace aging workers, Crossett said.

""It's putting manufacturing in danger of not really being able to compete locally, nationally or even internationally,"" he said.

""That was the main premise of why this grant was created.""

That's why Stephen Copperwheat, president of Environmental Composites Inc., in Utica, decided to apply for grants to start two apprenticeship programs.

""We're a relatively new manufacturer,"" he said.

""We've been in business now for about 10 years, but we have a need for skilled maintenance people in the manufacturing setting. We have to have a mechanic basically, a skilled millwright.""

So a maintenance technician apprentice started several months ago and the company now is looking for an apprentice electrician, he said.

The Workforce Development Board received a $2.9 million federal grant to run the American Apprenticeship Initiative in 19 Central New York counties from 2015 to 2020.

The grants give companies up to $3,000 per apprentice to cover the cost of education beyond on-the-job training, Crossett said.

They're also available for apprenticeships in cybersecurity and information technology; nanotechnology; and drones, but nanotechnology hasn't appeared locally yet and the drone industry isn't really hiring yet, he said.

Apprenticeships have started through the Air Force Research Lab and the Griffiss Institute in Rome, Crossett said.

""We're starting to branch out and do apprenticeships in information technology because that's the future as well,"" he said.

Apprenticeships are a great way for young people to train for a skilled job with good pay and benefits without going into debt paying for college, said Patrick Costello, president of the Central New York Labor Council and assistant business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 43.

Apprenticeships are free and apprentices get paid a portion of a journeyman's salary while they learn with the amount going up as their skills increase, he said.

""It's like going to college and getting paid all the time you're going, getting a degree in a trade without having any student debt,"" Costello said.

""So, it's a pretty good deal.""

Journeymen in the building trades aren't left stranded and unemployed by the plant closures that have afflicted this area, he pointed out.

Costello, too, sees the model working for a wider variety of industries, including health care, for example.

""It's expensive to have a bona fide, realistic apprenticeship program,"" he said.

""I think the only way you can do it is to have the employers buy in.""

Unions pay for the programs in the skilled trades and now the apprenticeship initiative grants are helping other industries.

""It's the industry investing in the future of the industry,"" Costello said.

Mahoning Valley Manufacturers Coalition and Greater Oh-Penn Manufacturing Apprenticeship Network are planning an event to aid in finding employees.

Coalition officials say all companies at both events will be seeking candidates for full-time positions and entry into apprenticeship training programs.

Officials say they will be looking for candidates with employment history and a willingness to learn.

""While manufacturing experience is preferred, it is not required. This is a significant shift where manufacturers are willing to invest in candidates who have demonstrated dependability in unrelated jobs that may not offer the advancement opportunities and related pay and benefits,"" says MVMC Executive Director Jessica Borza.

Following a $2.9M grant from the U.S. Department of Labor's American Apprenticeship Initiative program, MVMC and the Apprenticeship Network brought the latest apprenticeship innovations to the region.

The Department's have been working over the past two years with education and training providers to create more flexible and responsive programs.

317,Joseph Hauger,3/22/2018 0:00,"BALTIMORE - The Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation today announced a new registered apprenticeship program with CVS Health, and expanded opportunities for Maryland workers in other non-traditional apprenticeship occupations and industries.

At the March meeting of the Maryland Apprenticeship and Training Council, six new sponsors became part of the state's apprenticeship program, three reactivated their programs, and three expanded their existing programs into new occupations.

""Apprenticeship is a smart workforce development program that works for any industry,"" said Labor Secretary Kelly M. Schulz.

""While the skilled trades have been the predominant force in apprenticeship - and continue to be an effective career development tool in those fields - we are seeing a solid shift into non-traditional trades, such as healthcare and information technology. Today's announcement exemplifies that shift, with new occupations in emerging fields.""

Having become the nation's first employer to start a U.S. Department of Labor registered apprenticeship program for pharmacy technicians in 2005, CVS Health is also the first to sponsor a program in Maryland for pharmacy technician and pharmacy managers.

Apprentices will receive structured training through the CVS Health Regional Learning Centers in the District of Columbia and District Heights, Maryland, to maintain the high levels of skills needed in the pharmacy field, and will be eligible to apply for a position at one of more than 220 locations in the state.

""As the skills gap in the U.S. widens, CVS Health recognizes the important role apprenticeships, which offer on-the-job training with classroom instruction, play in building a pipeline of future skilled talent,"" said David Casey, vice president, workforce strategies and chief diversity officer for CVS Health.

""Our new registered apprenticeship program will provide an opportunity for people in Maryland to discover a meaningful career in the world of pharmacy.""

In addition to CVS Health, Cooper Electrical Services, ConnectWork, LLC, Maryland Burglar and Fire Alarm Association, Npower, and the Education Foundation for Baltimore County Public Schools became new apprenticeship sponsors, while Allstate Floors, W.L. Gore and Associates Inc., and Worthington Armstrong Venture reactivated their programs, bringing the total of Maryland's active apprenticeship sponsors to 136.

1199 SEIU League Training and Upgrading Fund, the Baltimore Alliance for Careers in Healthcare, and the Maryland Manufacturing Extension Partnership expanded their existing programs.

These expansions included new occupations, such as BACH's surgical technologist and MD MEP's additive manufacturing technician 3d printing.

MEP's additive manufacturing occupation is not just a first for Maryland, but is, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the first in the nation.

""We are excited about the new apprenticeship occupation for additive manufacturing technician,"" said MEP Director Michael Kelleher.

""The program was put together in response to the needs of the Maryland manufacturing community and it also addresses the changing and emerging technologies in manufacturing. This is a great opportunity for Maryland to be at the forefront of new technologies related to Industry 4.0 and help prepare the manufacturing workforce of the future.""

""The increase of STEM-related occupations is very exciting,"" said Schulz.

""It is estimated that, this year, 71 percent of all jobs in the nation will require STEM skills. Apprenticeship occupations like digital media specialist, IT services specialist, and IT generalist will give our workforce the skills they need to succeed in today's marketplace, and will give our job creators a talented labor pool that will help their businesses thrive.""

Since January 2015, the number of registered apprentices has grown by nearly 20 percent; today there are more than 9,300 apprentices learning and earning throughout Maryland.

In 2017, a total of 15 new registered apprenticeship programs were created and seven were re-activated, resulting in a record year for the program.

Apprenticeships are full-time jobs that include on-the-job training and classroom instruction, allowing apprentices to earn while they learn.

Anyone 18 or older can be a registered apprentice, while high school students can pursue youth apprenticeships."
320,Staff,3/22/2018 5:50,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - Hard physical labor and a demanding learning experience are paving the way to new and financially rewarding careers for apprentice cement masons.

Thomas Krashoff, 32, and Brandon Banks-Hall, 28, are in the first year of their three-year apprenticeships during which they'll be paid for their on-the-job training.

Both are working so they can earn more than they did in their earlier jobs.

""I have four kids, so I want to make sure they have a good life,"" says Krashoff, a Youngstown resident who worked 10 years as a cook and three as a landscaper.

After completing the apprenticeship, cement masons earn $30 per hour and another $17 in benefits.

Wages and a pension prompted Krashoff to enter the apprenticeship, as did the long-term job prospects.

""It's something that's always going to be there. Concrete is what everything's built with for the most part,"" he says.

""A hundred years from now, something I built will be there.""

Adds Banks-Hall of Sharon, Pa., ""I've worked in a few different industries, from trucking to retail to food service. This is what I like right here, where you get the trade and you get the skills to pay the bills.""

Success as a cement mason takes patience, hard work, finesse, ""Knowledge and experience, first and foremost, and a great team,"" they say.

A recent training session at the Structural Ironworkers' Local 207 hall on Bev Road found them finishing cement with 12 other apprentices who range in age from 20 to 40.

Local 526 of the Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons' International Association offers the program.

""We're trying to teach them a skilled trade so that they have a career,"" says program instructor Jesse Clay.

Cement masons work outdoors in all kinds of weather, including extreme heat and humidity.

""When the news says, 'Don't go outside for more than 20 minutes,' that's when we're going out and working 10 or 12 hours,"" he says.

Apprentices pay no tuition and incur no student loan debt, says the local's business agent, Robert Gerst.

This year, 12 of 24 applicants were admitted to the program.

In addition to paid on-the-job training, apprentices undergo four weeks of unpaid classroom training annually, including pouring and finishing.

""When they're done, we give them a true understanding of everything about concrete,"" Gerst says.

The apprenticeship program is sponsored jointly by labor unions and the Builders' Association of Eastern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania, with which the building trades negotiate their contracts.

The association represents about 150 construction contractors in Trumbull, Mahoning and Columbiana counties in Ohio and Lawrence and Mercer counties in Pennsylvania.

Apprenticeship program costs, including instructor compensation, are paid for by an allowance specified in the labor contracts.

In the cement masons' case, that allowance is 25 cents per hour worked by the journeymen in that union.

Apprenticeships run three to five years, depending on the trade, and apprentices incur little to no out-of-pocket costs.

Apprentices must be at least 18 years old, hold a high school diploma or the equivalent and pass a drug test to be admitted.

""Once you get that training, you have a skill set that cannot be taken away from you and that is transferable anywhere in the country,"" says Kevin Reilly, executive vice president of The Builders, based in Vienna Township.

Opportunities also exist for advancement into supervisor or ownership roles, Reilly notes.

Projected employment growth in the building trades by 2026 is generally faster than the 7% average growth for all occupations, reports the U.S. Department of Labor.

Projected growth rates are 16% for plumbers and pipefitters, 13% for ironworkers, 12% each for masonry workers, construction equipment operators and laborers, and 11% each for roofers and glaziers.

Other projected growth rates are 9% for boilermakers, electricians and sheet metal workers, 8% for carpenters, 6% for painters and 5% for insulation workers.

""The last two summers, there have been a lot of days where I was 10 to 15 guys short and couldn't fill orders for contractors who called,"" Gerst says.

""We have guys in the hall that make $70,000 or $80,000 a year with full benefits. We have guys that make $10,000 or $15,000 a year.""

""It's what you make of it. If a guy is a self-starter, a motivated person and a hard worker, the sky is the limit,"" he says.

""We are a referral hall. We don't dictate to the contractor who they're going to employ.""

A major contributor to the availability of construction work would be passage of a massive infrastructure improvement bill.

""If there's an infrastructure plan that's approved, the outlook is even greater than what it would normally be,"" Reilly says.

Motorists don't necessarily see structural deficiencies under bridge decks, but the road surface maintenance needs are highly visible, Reilly observes, calling infrastructure maintenance and upgrades ""Crucial.""

""When you're driving down the road and hitting potholes, you know that work needs done on the roads.""

322,President Donald J. Trump,3/22/2018 15:40,"Quote Today's apprentices will construct the roads and bridges that move our citizens, they will bend the metal and steel that shape our cities, and they will pioneer the new technology that drives our commerce.

AMERICA NEEDS A STRONG WORKFORCE: Americans do not have sufficient access to high-quality education and workforce-development programs, causing too many jobs to remain unfilled and making it difficult for many businesses to grow.

American workers have been left behind and jobs have been left unfilled due to insufficient access to skills-development and education programs.

An increase in infrastructure investment will spur new projects that will further boost labor demand in infrastructure sectors, and in the broader economy.

There are 6.3 million job openings in the United States, the highest number on record.

There are 250,000 job openings in the construction industry.

There are 305,000 job openings in transportation, warehousing, and utilities.

According to a February 2018 survey of small business owners by the National Federation of Independent Business: ""22 percent of owners cited the difficulty of finding qualified workers as their Single Most Important Business Problem."" The survey also found that: ""90 percent of those hiring or trying to hire reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill."" 65 percent of all jobs will require some education or training beyond high school by 2020, according to a 2014 study by Georgetown University.

EMPOWERING AMERICAN WORKERS: President Trump's infrastructure proposal will help prepare our workers for the jobs of today and tomorrow, generating greater economic opportunity for more Americans.

The President's proposal for rebuilding infrastructure in America includes critical reforms to improve access to high-quality education and workforce-development programs.

The proposal would expand Pell Grant eligibility to high-quality, short-term programs that lead to a credential or certification in a high-demand field, helping Americans who want a well-paying job get one more quickly.

Currently, Pell Grant recipients cannot use their grant dollars for short-term programs.

The President's proposal would reform the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education program so that more students have access to skills-focused education.

Congress must improve the CTE program so participants are better prepared to fill jobs in high-demand fields and so more funds go to programs which are in line with local workforce needs.

The proposal calls for several reforms to the Perkins CTE program that would: Direct the majority of CTE high school funding to promote strategies such as expanding apprenticeships, work-based learning, and dual-enrollment opportunities.

Authorize funding for fast-track programs that prepare high school students for infrastructure jobs.

President Trump's proposal would reform the Federal Work Study program to better distribute aid and ensure more participants gain relevant workplace experience.

These reforms would increase the program's focus on quality two-year programs that promote workforce readiness.

PROMOTING GREATER OPPORTUNITY AND PROSPERITY: The President's proposal for rebuilding infrastructure in America will further his Administration's commitment to promoting economic opportunity.

Providing greater access to quality education and skills-development programs will help American workers fill needed, well-paying jobs.

Workforce development programs, such as apprenticeships, have a proven track record of providing economic opportunity for American workers.

According to Department of Labor data, over 90 percent of participants gain employment after completing apprenticeship programs and receive an average starting wage of $60,000.

Without the burden of student loan debt, apprenticeship program graduates see a $300,000 lifetime earnings increase.

In June 2017, the President signed an Executive Order to expand access to apprenticeships and workforce-development programs, which: Directed the Department of Labor to use available funding to promote apprenticeships.

Directed the Secretary of Education to support efforts by community colleges and two-year and four-year institutions to incorporate apprenticeship programs into their curricula.

Established a Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion to identify ways to promote apprenticeships."

327,Staff,3/24/2018 0:22,"The growth of Horizon Roofing has been restrained in recent years by a lack of workers willing to labor outdoors in all temperatures for $16 to $20 an hour.

Owner Kurt Scepaniak, whose father started the business in 1976, said he spent $100,000 in online employment and billboard ads a couple of years ago and still couldn't find enough talent.

""Last year, we peaked at about 95 employees,"" Scepaniak said.

Scepaniak also in 2017 launched an in-house training program that he believes will help meet customer orders and boost growth.

The program costs an estimated $125,000 yearly, including a full-time trainer.

Prospects train for seven days at Horizon's operations in Brooklyn Center and Waite Park, near St. Cloud.

""I think we'll need 125 to 130"" workers during the spring-to-fall outdoor season, Scepaniak said.

""We need good workers, willing to work in the elements. Usually, it's 45 hours a week, some weeks more. We have all races - white, black, Hispanic - mostly men, but we're hiring more women. They tend to be very detail-oriented and that's appealing.""People seem to learn faster during than in the traditional on-the-job training.

We see people who learn in seven days what can take six months in on-the-job training.

You can have a foreman or second-in-charge trying to train on the job and their job is to focus on a quality project in time and at a profit.

The training also helps mismatched applicants cut themselves if they aren't right for roofing work, which can pay up to $100,000 a year including overtime pay for the most skilled, veteran workers and foremen.

Horizon also offers health insurance, a 401(k) plan, vacation ""And some other things we do to sweeten the compensation,"" including family events.

Scepaniak said Horizon has grown sales over the past year by ""Nearly 200 percent"" to $19 million last year, and it could have been more in an economy marked by building and employers investing in plants and equipment.

""It may slow down a bit because of Mother Nature, but we try to keep everyone employed.""I started roofing at 12 in the family business,"" Scepaniak said.

""It's some of the toughest work in construction.

We mostly do flat roofs of metal, rubber and thermoplastics.

We do new construction, including laying up the insulation, laying out the membranes, the detail work, as well as maintenance and repair of sheet metal work.

Scepaniak is one of a growing legion of employers who have embraced training programs and apprenticeships in a Minnesota economy hungry for workers.

Last week, Minnesota's unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent, compared to 4.1 percent nationally, the lowest Minnesota rate since 2000.

The state basically is at full employment, with most of the increases coming from new workers and those re-entering the labor force.

The tight labor market ""translates into improving job opportunities for those who have struggled to find work in the past,"" said Commissioner Shawntera Hardy of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.

The estimate for the 12-month average of black unemployment fell from 7.4 percent in January to a new low of 6.9 percent in February.

The unemployment rate for Latinos fell from 4 percent to 3.3 percent over the month.

Economists said Minnesota's tight labor market has made it hard for manufacturers, construction firms and repair-service firms to fill job vacancies and replace departing retirees.

Minorities are the fastest growing component of the labor force, and retirees are being lured out of the house to make an extra buck or two.

Employer associations and cooperating unions are working jointly to expand the labor pool.

A host of Twin Cities nonprofit trainers, including Project for Pride in Living, Twin Cities Rise, Emerge and Summit Academy, train the underemployed, help with GEDs and job certifications, and place graduates with employers in financial services, health care, construction and more.

Some graduates are rebounding from addictions or criminal backgrounds.

The training is funded by fees, private philanthropy and government grants.

The growing Minnesota Apprenticeship Initiative, jointly run by DEED and the Department of Labor and Industry, offers grants to assist private employers with the cost of developing apprenticeship programs.

Employers can receive up to $5,000 for each apprentice to help cover costs.

MAI seeks to help 100-plus employers develop apprenticeship programs to recruit, train and retrain 1,000 new apprentices in advanced manufacturing, agriculture, health care services, information technology and transportation.

Last week, Agco launched an apprenticeship program at its Jackson, Minn., tractor manufacturing plant to train long-sought mechanics and welders.

Having spent the early part of his professional life in a variety of jobs, John was ready for a career that would lead to stability.

He knew that the trades would provide the benefits, wages and growth potential to support his family and took the initiative to get involved in an apprenticeship program.

Registered Apprenticeship is a program managed by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, in partnership with industry, combining on-the-job training with classroom instruction that allows participants to gain paid work experience while also obtaining the necessary training for their new careers.

""I didn't need to choose between work and school. I was able to make good money and keep a job while getting the training I needed.""

John is training to be a Steamfitter and receives some of the highest quality training available at United Association Local 434, a union for plumbers and steamfitters.

While going back to school can be daunting, John says that the classroom environment is very comfortable and inviting.

He's been able to take his hands-on instruction and apply it directly to his job.

The apprenticeship model is an affordable option and John has been able to benefit from the earn-and-learn concept while financially supporting his wife and two daughters.

""I've been able to change careers and go back to school without going into debt.""

For the past four years, John has worked as a Steamfitter Apprentice for Mechanical Incorporated in Tomahawk, Wisconsin, an industrial and mechanical contractor that services many of the manufacturing and industrial sites in Central Wisconsin.

Mechanical Incorporated has been using the apprenticeship model for nearly 30 years.

Currently, they employ five apprentices in the sheet metal, pipefitter/steamfitter and pipefitter service occupations.

""Registered Apprenticeship allows us to learn about our employees and help train them on our systems and processes before they become journeymen,"" said Mike Merryfield, General Manager.

At Mechanical Incorporated, apprentices work side-by-side with journeyworker and get the advantage of a hands-on experience.

They have a built-in support network at the company and are able to ask the experts around them about the day-to-day work, classroom instruction, and best practices.

In his role, John has been able to grow his skills beyond the Steamfitter occupation and has gained an understanding about customer service from the journeyworkers he works with.

John Burrow is in his fifth and final year of his Steamfitter apprenticeship before he becomes a journeyworker.

He started his career in the trades with Mechanical Incorporated and intends to stay.

""Our apprentices are the most loyal employees. We definitely see a better retention rate from those who went through an apprenticeship,"" Merryfield asserts.

In addition to their loyalty, Mike Merryfield continues to seek apprentices for his business because he wants the best of the best representing Mechanical Incorporated out in the field.

""The Registered Apprenticeship training program is second to none,"" Merryfield avows.

Now, because of his experience with Registered Apprenticeship, John Burrow is now one of the best.

The fourth industrial revolution has ushered in automation and precision manufacturing that increasingly requires highly specialized skills. Employers, government officials and higher education leaders alike are looking for a way for workers to acquire the expertise needed for the jobs of tomorrow.  Apprenticeships are typically associated with Germany, but they are gaining steam in the U.S. After all, there are more than 500,000 Americans currently in apprenticeship programs that offer an alternative pathway to traditional higher education -- one that is capable of bridging the STEM talent gap.

What makes the apprenticeship model so effective is a mix of classroom instruction at a high school, college or university with on-the-job training. That combination is invaluable in a rapidly changing industrial community where extremely specific skill sets are required.  However, colleges, universities or employers interested in starting an apprenticeship program should be wary of simply copying the German model. The two countries? education and training systems are too different. To be successful, the U.S. must adapt the German model. To be certain, this will require work and there may be some missteps along the way, but the long-term benefit is immense."

The facility is the first American Job Center in the state to be certified by the U.S. Department of Labor as a registered apprenticeship program sponsor.

The center received $255,000 in federal and state funding to begin a new manufacturing apprenticeship pilot program.

""I am pleased that this program has been opened up to include current employees,"" said Scott J. Drachnik, executive director of the Missouri Job Center of St. Charles County.

""Now, employers can use this training and wage assistance program to help their existing employees learn new skills and take on new levels of responsibilities in their businesses.""

""Apprenticeships have been around for centuries, but there is a new and growing awareness by businesses and job-seekers across America about this proven method of training workers and filling job openings. We are looking for more local manufacturers to work with to help them hire and train individuals who will receive occupational credentials from the U.S. Department of Labor after they successfully complete this new pilot program.""

Drachnik said there are five core components in the registered apprenticeship program: 1) Training on the job, 2) Classroom training, 3) Work mentorship, 4) Progressive wages, and 5) National occupational credentialing.

The St. Charles County program, which began in 2017, uses a competency-based model which allows expedited advancement based on demonstrated performance, rather than a minimum timeframe spent in training.

Or already have eligible workers, could receive reimbursement of wages for up to six months during their training period.

Participating employers must agree at the outset to hire their apprentice as a full-time employee and wages must start at $12 an hour or higher.

Interested employers and job-seekers who are interested in learning more about this registered apprenticeship program should contact Vicki Swartzenberg at 636-255-6060, ext."

348,Cheyenne Derksen Schroeder McPherson Sentinel,3/28/2018 10:13,"A major expansion on the north side of town is set to bring 100 jobs to McPherson.

Viega LLC is breaking ground for a new manufacturing facility and also plans on bringing a master distribution facility to McPherson.

The new facility brings Viega's total manufacturing square footage in McPherson to 700,000 and is expected to bring around 100 new jobs to the area.

Viega's new 204,000-square-foot facility will manufacture their ProPress Copper product line.

""Due to the continued success of our ProPress product in the U.S. market, we needed additional manufacturing capacity. We've also been very encouraged with the quality and success we've had with the skilled workforce in McPherson,"" wrote Robert Boots, COO of Viega, in a press release.

The company has expanded twice since opening adding more than 170,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space - for carbon steel press fittings in 2014 and copper fittings in 2016.

In addition to the new manufacturing facility, Viega is in the initial planning stages of moving its Atlanta-based master distribution center to McPherson in late 2018.

The master distribution center will house its metal products and the company will also maintain a smaller, satellite distribution center in Atlanta.

The state-of-the-art distribution center will feature the latest technology and automation, as well as an upgraded warehouse management system that will provide faster product turnaround.

""Centralizing Viega's manufacturing and distribution in McPherson is a strategic effort to prepare for the future growth and continued demand of Viega products,"" Boots said.

""This is all part of Viega's commitment to continually provide the best-in-class service that our customers have come to expect.""

Viega's headquarters is in Broomfield, Colorado and has satellite distribution centers in Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and a training facility in New Hampshire.

As part of the expansion, more apprenticeship opportunities will be available to students.

Launched in January 2017, Viega's Apprenticeship Program is a collaborative effort with Hutchinson Community College.

Viega is also designing a special apprenticeship training lab that gives students hands-on experience with robotics, machining and tooling, as well as a processing lab.

""This program is one strategy that we are using at Viega to respond to the labor shortage that we are experiencing across the nation,"" wrote Eric Wicker, director of manufacturing at Viega, in a press release.

""Our apprenticeship program lays the groundwork for building future technical talent - especially as our manufacturing facility continues to expand.""

Enrolled students receive a three-year associate degree paid in full by Viega, in addition to receiving a paid position for working in Viega's plastics, metals, machining or maintenance divisions, and the potential to earn other employee benefits.

Upon graduation from the apprenticeship program, graduates will be offered full-time positions at Viega.

Currently, two students from the inaugural class are receiving specialized training in plastics technology from Pittsburg State University, a school recognized for its Plastics Engineering Technology Program that emphasizes detailed technical knowledge, as well as real world application.

""As the Apprenticeship Program continues to evolve and gain momentum, we are pleased not only to add additional students, but also that our current students are successfully learning and progressing through the program,"" Wicker said.

""We've had positive responses from both the students and the Viega employees who work alongside them."""

Saw a 96% increase in the number of women enrolled in its Building Trades' Joint Apprenticeship Training programs.

8730 apprentices in Joint Apprenticeship Training programs were female.

Executive Director of Affiliated Construction Trades Ohio., attributes the increase to continued concerted efforts by the Building Trades to diversify its workforce.

""The Building Trades offer tremendous opportunities for growth and advancement,"" said Szollosi.

""Both at the local level and here at the state level, we are doing a better job of explaining that those opportunities are available to any person who is willing to work hard.""

Working under a collectively bargained agreement also means no pay gap, something that is prevalent in corporate America.

First-year plumbing and pipefitting apprentice Stacie Alexander.

""I attended college and had an office job,"" says Alexander.

""But there was no job satisfaction. I wasn't making a livable wage and I definitely wasn't able to have the lifestyle that I wanted for my kids.""

Alexander is happy with her decision to join the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 189, and hopes more women see the opportunities the Building Trades offer.

""Women need to understand that we can do the same work, we just do it differently,"" she says.

""It can seem intimidating, but it is all about safety. This is good work for women.""

There is a push at both the state and national levels for more workforce training.

354,Matt Arco,3/29/2018 12:58,"New Jersey's trade unions stand to benefit from Gov. Phil Murphy's first budget to the tune of $10 million, the governor announced Thursday.

That's because the new governor wants to spend $10 million to help support union apprenticeship programs and other partnerships the administration has yet to detail.

Murphy announced his plans at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Edison for a new training facility for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters.

""As you flip the switch on this new apprenticeship facility,"" Murphy said.

""Please sign me up as your partner.""

Murphy trashes Christie, and these public workers cheer.

The governor unveiled his $37.4 billion state budget proposal, which calls for some $1.6 billion in new taxes, on March 13.

Now it's time for Murphy to sell his blueprint to his base as he works behind the scenes with lawmakers to craft a final budget ahead of the state's June 30 deadline.

He was doing just that among some 200 carpenters and other officials on Thursday.

""New Jersey was built by union hands and by working together we will see that union hands rebuild it,"" Murphy said.

""We will provide support for apprenticeship programs like this one right here,"" he said, ""Along with other union-led apprenticeship programs.""

Some of the $10 million Murphy wants to spend on trade unions would go to the newly established New Jersey Apprenticeship Network, which would include the training facility he visited.

The funding would come from the $34.5 million in his budget designated for the Workforce Development Partnership Program."
356,Eric Wildstein,3/29/2018 16:05,"Middle and high school students became acquainted with potential careers in advanced manufacturing Thursday at Gaston College.

In partnership with Gaston's public school system, local manufacturing companies and economic development organizations, the community college hosted its annual Advanced Manufacturing Career Expo at its Dallas campus.

About 800 students from 22 Gaston schools attended the expo, where they visited the displays from participating manufacturers, met with their representatives and learned about employment opportunities at each.

This is the first year that middle school students have been invited to participate in the expo.

Students also gleaned information about the education required for various job positions and opportunities to receive financial assistance.

Landon Brice, a junior at East Gaston High School, has helped his father detail vehicles for years, and recently started his own side business detailing cars.

He attended the event to learn more about welding classes and other ways that he can learn the skills required in the field of auto body repair and detailing.

""There's pretty good money in that field,"" said Brice.

""I wanted to expand my knowledge on careers I could have for my path in the future.""

Several demonstrations were also held at the adjacent Center for Advanced Manufacturing in the Gastonia Technology Park.

Gaston College opened the $18 million Center last year to expand its training offerings for students and to help better equip local manufacturers with a skilled workforce.

The expo has led to a variety success stories for students who have attended the event in the past.

Daniel Vasquez Ramos attended previous career expos as a student at Stuart W. Cramer High, where he met with representatives from and learned about opportunities with the American & Efird textiles company.

After graduating high school in June 2017, he gained employment at American & Efird and has since held various jobs.

He currently works there with dye machines and measuring the chemicals required for specific batches of product.

""I am most interested in learning the basics of electrical engineering and mechanics, and I hope to one day enter an apprenticeship at A&E,"" said Ramos, who has aspirations become an electrical engineer.

Gaston College also introduced students to its existing Apprenticeship 321 program, where students can receive job-specific training and a cost-free education and simultaneously earn money working for a manufacturing company.

The college recently received a $200,000 grant investment from Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas, which will be used for tuition support for advanced manufacturing students participating in Apprenticeship 321.

This spring, the college and public school system will help to jumpstart the careers of rising high school seniors through a new pre-apprenticeship program.

The program will offer such students an opportunity to investigate careers through part-time jobs with participating companies.

During their pre-apprenticeship, students who are enrolled in their high schools' Career and Technical Education programs will complete coursework related to one of the occupational pathways currently offered in the Apprenticeship 321 program.

Such pathways include chemical operator, industrial maintenance mechanic and machine setup operator, to name a few.

The students will participate in daily operations at the workplace, develop direct contact with employees, and learn about particular careers while performing certain assigned job tasks within the company.

""Through this program, they can get their foot in the door and when they have finished high school they can start at a higher placement level at the company than someone who has no prior experience with that employer,"" said Brett Buchanan, Career and Technical Education director for Gaston's public schools.

""If they continue on to the Apprenticeship 321 program, they will be able to make money, save money on the cost of education, and earn a certificate in their trade."""

362,Keith Meyer,3/30/2018 12:52,"On Tuesday, March 13, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission determined they now have the information necessary to complete their analysis and publish a schedule for the drafting of an Environmental Impact Statement for the Alaska LNG project.

The outcome of this process should be an order on March 8, 2020, that authorizes the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation to construct Alaska LNG. On behalf of AGDC and Alaskans across the state, I want to say how grateful I am to FERC and this federal administration for their responsiveness and action on this critical infrastructure project.

AGDC first filed an application for a Natural Gas Act Section 3 permit with FERC on April 17, 2017.

That application reflected thousands of hours of work by our team.

FERC reviewed more than 60,000 pages of AGDC reports in just eight months.

They responded with 801 questions seeking clarification and further data.

AGDC provided responses to 100 percent of those questions by the beginning of this year.

Additional questions are inevitable and typical of a project of this magnitude.

We anticipate that we will continue to go back and forth in dialogue with FERC throughout the permitting process.

It is nothing short of commendable how quickly and thoroughly the lead federal regulators have worked with us so far.

The gasline is a vital component of Alaska's future and will turbocharge our economy.

The Alaska LNG project will be the nation's largest energy project.

This project will bring thousands of jobs to Alaskans, slash the cost of energy in our communities, and allow Alaska's massive, proven but stranded natural gas resources to secure energy dominance for our country.

Construction equals jobs and could begin as early as 2020.

We anticipate up to 12,000 direct jobs during construction.

The range of direct and indirect occupations involved in this project will require a workforce from across the state.

In response to the FERC announcement, the president of the Alaska AFL-CIO stated, ""We are heartened by this great news from FERC. In a short while we, along with many other Alaska organizations, will be building a workforce for this project which will help turn our lagging construction economy around.""

Alaska businesses and resident workers will be first in line to benefit.

The State of Alaska's Alaska Bidder and Alaska Hire policies and a strong project labor agreement will make certain this happens.

Alaskans are already training for the various roles this project will require.

We can be proud of our network of in-state Joint Apprenticeship Training Centers, career and technical education providers, Registered Apprenticeship programs, and the University of Alaska system.

We have long been at the top of the game when it comes oil and gas related training and Fairbanks hosts the only comprehensive pipeline industry training center in the United States.

To meet the employment needs of this project with Alaska Hire, we must continue to expand the capacity of Alaska's training programs and institutions.

We all know that high energy costs have long presented a chokepoint for Alaska's economy.

Once the pipeline is complete, Alaska gas will go to Alaska communities before making its way to Asia.

Access to this new source of energy could lower the cost of energy in communities like Fairbanks by half or more.

Thanks to state Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, 20 percent of the state's ownership royalty share will go toward a rural capital energy fund so even communities off the pipeline corridor will benefit.

Finally, we recognize that reducing the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China is a top priority for our federal administration.

Our analysts believe that no project in the country could have a greater immediate impact on reducing that trade imbalance.

Leaders in Washington, D.C., have made it clear they recognize that potential as well.

Alaska's congressional delegation, our Legislature and our local community leaders all deserve a lot of credit for their commitment and vision for this project.

With another critical step forward two weeks ago, the team at AGDC is on track to make the Alaska LNG project deliver for all Alaskans, from Kotzebue to Ketchikan.

Keith Meyer is the president of the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation."
364,Mary Rittling,3/31/2018 2:01,"Those unfamiliar with 21st century apprenticeships may believe on-the-job training no longer exists.  There is certainly a higher demand for skilled workers ready to add value immediately upon hiring, and educated apprentices do this by bringing with them academic preparation and hands-on classroom experiences.  They also bring a proven willingness and capacity to continue learning. Apprenticeships still occur today and are a great benefit to employers as well as students.

A variety of industries utilize apprenticeships to prepare their next generation of skilled employees. Essentially, apprenticeships offer on-the-job training in highly specialized occupations.  Over the past several years, Davidson County Community College has sought to introduce the idea or help better establish programs that allow students to pair their classroom knowledge with real world experiences, all while gaining professional employment."
370,Staff,4/2/2018 8:38,"Those labels are given to apprentices, who appear to be taken seriously right now by the state of Tennessee.

The states of Alabama and South Carolina have established apprenticeship programs.

""We don't have a state strategy,"" said Ann Thompson, workforce development director at the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development.

As a result, ECD has been conducting a statewide ""Apprenticeship Tour"" to network with employers and educators and develop that strategy.

The tour made a stop last Tuesday at Northeast State's Regional Center for Advanced Manufacturing - ground zero for apprenticeship training in Kingsport.

""What occurs here in Northeast Tennessee is very unique apprenticeship is not a dirty word to you,"" Thompson told about 60 educators and employers at the RCAM. ""This is a listening tour this is not a time to talk about all the great things of this state.""

Thompson pointed out there were 5.8 million open positions in the nation as of last December with an overall 4.1 percent unemployment rate.

Both Tennessee's and Virginia's unemployment rate is currently under 4 percent.

""There's an issue here,"" Thompson noted.

"" There are people not matched to the jobs we need, and we need to close that gap together it's no secret that Eastman is our largest utilizer of apprenticeship programs the goal is to go after additional grant dollars to implement this strategy.

Eastman Training Associate Laurey Conway noted Eastman currently has 408 apprentices in 12 different occupations.

""There are several different benefits to an apprentice program,"" she told the group.

""The main one is we know how to train people who do not know how to be mechanics, or operators or lab analysts, etc. we also call it a structured training program it used to be book learning, nowadays it's mostly online but they test on job-related material they have to be qualified and certified.""

Jeff McCord, Northeast State's vice president for Economic and Workforce Development, pointed out one of the things the community college has the benefit of seeing is companies like Eastman having a long history of apprenticeships.

""A journeyman certificate is a degree. You have a different accrediting body but it's a degree,"" McCord insisted."
376,Staff,4/3/2018 12:07,"Officials with the Wilkes County Schools and Wilkes Community College are on the right track in starting an apprenticeship program.

Now, more local employers need to join this effort to address their need for skilled workers, reduce employee turnover and improve productivity.

Simultaneously, they'll be providing pathways for young Wilkes Countians to gain decent-paying jobs and practical education with virtually no debt.

Apprenticeships are jobs in which workers are paid to learn a set of skills through on-the-job training.

The apprenticeship program in North Carolina and many other places includes classroom instruction, for which students also are paid.

In North Carolina, employers work with state officials to create written agreements that specify the length of a participant's training, related technical instruction, an outline of skills apprentices need to learn and wages they will earn.

Wages increase as apprentices progress in the program, thus providing incentives to become more valuable employees.

England, Germany and other countries rely on apprenticeships as a primary way to develop a highly skilled, competitive workforce because they boost workers' earnings and raise productivity levels of participating companies.

Adjusting for population size, the United States has less than 10 percent of the number of apprenticeships in the United Kingdom.

Closer to home, South u00c7arolina has one of America's strongest apprenticeship programs.

Our sister state's success is to some extent attributed to starting students in the program after their junior year of high school with classwork and on-the-job training.

In Wilkes, it also starts the summer after a student's junior year.

South Carolina also offers tax credits for participating companies, which North Carolina should consider.

The traditional route for apprenticeships is the building trades and local contractors have said there is a great need in Wilkes for people with electrical, plumbing and similar skills.

South Carolina's apprenticeship program from the beginning encouraged participation of other fields like nursing, pharmacy and information technology.

The concept of a formal, paid training program can be applied to almost any occupation.

England has overhauled its apprenticeship program in recent years, resulting in a majority of new British apprentices now choosing programs in service sectors such as business administration and retail.

The initial participating companies in the inaugural program in Wilkes illustrate this diversity with their pre-apprenticeships, which are designed to lead to apprenticeships.

Industrial maintenance technicians at Inteflex Group, Jeld-Wen, Gardner-Glass Products and ECMD with apprenticeships inu202f at;.

Cyber-security specialists and graphic designers at Infusion Points;.

Manual machinists and machine builders at Meadows Mills;.

IT support technicians and network support representatives at Wilkes Communications.

Surveys show that nearly all U.S. employers who sponsor apprenticeship programs recommend them.

Businesses in countries with more expansive apprenticeship programs show very high levels of satisfaction.

Apprenticeships are a proven workforce development tool that offers substantial benefits to both workers and businesses, thus improving quality of life in communities with these programs."

Funds will be administered by the state's labor department's Workforce Development Partnership Program, and the governor's budget also includes $34.5 million for new and expanded programs from that division.

While stakeholders test various approaches to solving the skills gap, the federal government is betting on apprenticeships. And some states and employers are following suit.  New Jersey is latest to do so, and the fact that the state's program was announced at a carpentry training center may signal that construction and related fields may be a focus. In the wake of a devastating hurricane season last year, many training programs for carpenters and construction workers were fast-tracked. But even as recovery efforts have waned, the need for skilled workers has not. Similarly, major retailers in the home improvement industry, like Lowe?s and Home Depot, are providing training, mentoring and placement for employees to create a steady stream of workers for their contractor offerings."

397,Staff,4/5/2018 11:57,"The U.S. Department of Labor on April 4 announced an $82.5 million investment to help Americans exit incarceration and integrate into the workforce.

Through $82.5 million in grant funding, the Department will support communities in implementing comprehensive reentry programs to address the challenges faced by formerly incarcerated Americans as they transition into the workplace.

The investment will support programs that offer a range of services based on current evidence and proven research, as well as promising emerging practices.

""The evidence shows that an individual's inability to find gainful employment as they reenter society from incarceration is a strong predictor for recidivism,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta.

""If an individual returns to crime, the individual loses, their victims lose, and society loses. This $82.5 million investment will reduce recidivism and promote opportunity by helping Americans who are re-entering society become productive, responsible, and law-abiding citizens.""

The Department intends to invest in rural- and urban-serving organizations, including women's and minority organizations, state or local governments, and eligible Indian or Native American entities.

All projects must be located in high-crime, high-poverty communities.

The Department intends to conduct a rigorous evaluation of program models to build upon and contribute to the evidence base in the area of assisting formerly incarcerated Americans as they successfully transition back to the workplace, breaking the cycle of crime in vulnerable communities.

As the Department seeks to identify even more effective strategies, organizations applying for funding are encouraged to select, implement and test different program services and features of program models.

401,Staff,4/5/2018 13:07,"HISTORICAL PARTNERSHIP: The Fort Lauderdale Historical Society is collaborating with the city's Housing Authority to create opportunities for apprentices to gain experience.

A unique partnership is affording apprentices to gain valuable experience while also restoring a historical community building.

This partnership will allow apprentices to enhance their construction skills on historical restoration, as well as expand their professional portfolio.

""Our StepUP apprentices are kids that grew up without skills to get a meaningful job - through StepUP we've given them the opportunity to learn skills to become gainfully employed,"" said Tam English, executive director of the Housing Authority of the City of Fort Lauderdale.

""The Historical Society has a lot of wonderful historical buildings that need to be preserved and this is a great opportunity for our apprentices to repair and maintain these structures while showing off the skills they've gained in this program.""

Restoration of the New River Inn, which will be used as an educational center, will include new flooring, reinforcement of all floor joists, and new drywall.

StepUp participants performing the restoration will include one supervisor and up to four apprentices.

""Partnering with the StepUP program allows us to provide opportunities to apprentices who are building a new career in construction services. This partnership offers a unique experience that they would not have working on modern buildings,"" said Patricia Zeiler, executive director of the Fort Lauderdale Historical Society.

""Learning this system will open doors for them to restore other historical buildings, which is the heart of our mission - to cost effectively preserve structures rather than demolish and rebuild new ones.""

The StepUP apprentices will perform additional restoration work, including building windows, painting, basic plumbing, and general building maintenance on six FLHS buildings.

The StepUP Apprenticeship Program is a state certified program created by the HACFL in 1994 to provide apprentices with the opportunity to create a portfolio of education, training, and employment skills to increase their potential for permanent employment and economic selfsufficiency.

During the program, apprentices are trained in construction skills with a specialty in housing rehabilitation and building maintenance for occupations in the public and private sectors.

All apprentices are required to obtain their GED while in the program.

The program trains low-income public housing residents and at-risk youth, and has succeeded in helping hundreds of Fort Lauderdale neighbors find pathways out of poverty, while improving the public realm in the City.

""This is a unique opportunity for these men and women to hone their skills as they learn about the earlier stages of development and construction in our City. With this work, the StepUP story is now woven into the historic fabric of Old Fort Lauderdale,"" expressed Scott Strawbridge, director of Development and Facilities of the Housing Authority of the City of Fort Lauderdale.

""When our apprentices improve properties, they invariably experience a sense of pride and sense of place. We think this work can benefit our cities in the future."""
402,Staff,4/5/2018 14:24,"Employees have had positive work atmosphere because of company offerings.

A healthy work environment can mean the difference between a company prospering and a company going out of business.

Phaze Concrete has been able to succeed because of their impeccable work, but also their ability to have employees care about the job they are completing.

The secret to their success over the western portion of the United States is the treatment of their employees.

The company believes strongly in offering specific programs to their workers, so they don't view their occupation as ""Just a job.""

There are two offerings from Phaze Concrete that let the employees have a way to improve their lives.

These programs have become recognized by the national government and have paved the way for other companies to do the same.

While Phaze continues to lead in the concrete construction industry, they are also leading the way in employee treatment.

The company's attention has always been to provide quality concrete work to their clients.

Starting as a company pouring concrete for driveways and other small residential projects, they have emerged as a leader for mega-corporations looking to build a structure.

With over 250 team members working on any amounts of projects at one time, Phaze Concrete has created a positive work environment.

First and foremost, the company always provides a safe, pleasant, and professional work setting.

The safety of their employees has led to high marks in ratings.

Currently, their Experience Modification rating stands at 0.72%. The number shows the commitment of Phaze Concrete to creating a safe work atmosphere.

First, the program that has gained national attention is their apprenticeship offerings.

Phaze Concrete joined forces with the Department of Labor's sector devoted to these programs.

That sub-department is the Department of Apprenticeships.

The purpose of the program has always been offering high-quality on-the-job training and instruction for young workers.

Those in the program learn the proper techniques and teachings from experienced co-workers.

This particular program became praised by Alexander Acosta, the United States Secretary of Labor.

In May 2017, the cabinet member attended the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers' Meeting and talked about the importance of the apprenticeship program.

Support from the government continued to The White House Office of American Innovation, which became equally committed to supporting all types of apprenticeship programs.

The White House continues to build towards the goal of increasing the number of apprenticeships across the country.

The outlook has become bright, because of the success of Phaze Concrete and other companies across the country.

Currently, Phaze Concrete is one of over 37,000 different apprenticeship programs across the United States.

At Phaze Concrete, 26 young cement mason apprentices are participating in the company's plan.

The other offering from Phaze Concrete is their GED Readiness Program.

Any worker who does not have their GED while working for the company can earn it with the company's support.

The offering extends to that employee's family.

Anybody within the umbrella of Phaze Concrete has the chance to better their lives by earning the GED. Furthermore, before an employee takes the GED test, different courses and textbooks are available for studying.

What makes the program efficiently is that it takes no time away from earning a paycheck and working for the company.

The employee can study for the exam and become comfortable, but still, work and provide for their family.

In conclusion, these programs have attained success in the workplace.

Recently, the company earned the ACI Intermountain Chapter Award of Excellence for their flatwork and tilt-up work.

Founded in 2003, Phaze Concrete offers concrete construction work in multiple states across the western coast of the country.

408,Kelsey Houle,4/6/2018 11:01,"Institutions, industry address critical workforce issue.

The workforce shortage in the marine industry remains in a state of crisis, but companies are taking active steps toward finding and retaining the technicians and skilled laborers of the future.

The majority-over 80 percent by some estimation-of marine technicians still gain their core skills through on-the-job training, according to the Marine Career Training Institute of North America, based in Canton, Ga. Many companies today have access to manufacturer training, which is fine as far as it goes, but it's limited to product-specific information from each particular manufacturer, and it relies on the technician already possessing proper core skills.

""The boating industry is behind,"" Ellsworth said.

""Employers understand they have to step up and do something, but other industries are working hard on apprenticeships, and bringing more people in and training them.""

According to Ellsworth, the struggle involves an industry that primarily has smaller employers who are deep into the day-to-day of improving their businesses.

The boating industry has two significant technical training obstacles to overcome, said Todd Larson, marine repair instructor at Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College in Ashland.

This is where WITC's Marine Repair Technician Program, and other training programs can help.

""The industry just doesn't have the time to teach a budding technician the basics of engines on the job anymore,"" Larson said.

""I get calls every day from marine businesses looking for technicians, but there just aren't enough to go around. Colleges just don't have the marketing budgets to attract enough students to fill every seat in the classroom. We need help from the marine businesses. They need to go out into the community and promote the trade,"" he said.

""If every single marine business went out to one high school and made a presentation to students promoting the marine industry, I think it would make a big difference.""

""I believe the engine manufactures have to accept the thought that many of their engines are worked on by independent service centers, and there needs to be an industry avenue for those technicians to receive training.""

The marine industry has to address this problem, probably in a similar way as the auto industry did many years ago.

WITC's program includes instruction on marine engine service, operation, diagnosis, repair, equipment installation, maintenance and rigging new boats.

Students work on modern engines from manufactures such as Mercury Marine, Evinrude, Yamaha, Honda, and Volvo Penta.

""I think all colleges have figured out that we are all competing for a dwindling supply of prospective students. All of the trades are attempting to lure the same type of student, being it plumbing, construction, or marine technicians.""

Apprenticeship is one way to connect prospective workers and marine businesses, Larson said.

""Apprenticeships can work very well for the right business, especially if there is funding to offset the costs,"" Larson said, adding a nationwide educational effort will take a lot of industry funding.

Last December, the American Boat & Yacht Council announced the release of a marine service technology program to help secondary schools implement standards-based curriculum with an inland or coastal focus.

""We are thrilled to launch the only standards-based curriculum program in the marine industry and meet the needs of high school teachers,"" said Ed Sherman, ABYC vice president of education.

""Furthermore, by partnering with the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute, we can offer a nationally recognized series of exams that will provide successful students with an industry recognized entry-level credential.""

ABYC's goal is to make it very easy to implement an engaging marine service training program that will drive interest and help young people pursue rewarding careers in the marine industry, Sherman explained.

""Before I started using ABYC's textbook, I had to purchase several marine books to get all the material necessary for my students,"" said Rob Berenwick, instructor at Ocean County Vocational Technical School.

ABYC's effort addressed the school's needs in one book and the new curriculum package will make easier for Ocean County's marine program to excel, he said.

In early February, ABYC hosted eight marine industry employers, two representatives from Anne Arundel Community College, and the workforce development team from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland to discuss the creation of a marine industry apprenticeship program in the state of Maryland.

The goal of the meeting, as stated by MTAM Executive Director Susan Zellers, was for a group of Marine Trades Industry Partnership Employers to evaluate and give feedback about the curriculum developed by ABYC. With the buy-in from employers, the curriculum can be used to fulfill the classroom time required of a Maryland Marine apprenticeship program.

""ABYC's marine service technology program was created to address the industry's need for post-secondary technical education for aspiring marine professionals,"" Sherman said.

""The marine industry has many disciplines and I thought the test gave a good overview of the different elements,"" Anderson said.

The employers present were eager to hire, but were experiencing difficulty finding workers with knowledge of the recreational boating industry.

""I can train the technical aspects of the job. I really look for someone who has a general knowledge of boats. Even if someone is an electronics whiz, some sort of baseline of basic boat knowledge would be super helpful,"" said Ryan McQueeny of Marine Technical Services.

With the support of industry and education partners, MTAM will move forward with plans to work with the state of Maryland to develop an approved apprenticeship program with some of the employers in the Partnership.

""It is our hope such a program will fortify the recreational boating workforce, giving all of us a deeper pool of candidates to hire from, and strengthening the boating industry in Maryland,"" said John Norton, MTAM president and owner of Annapolis Harbor Boatyard.

In Florida, Warner University's Institute of Marine Technology has announced plans for a June on-campus national Marine Industry Training Conference.

Designed to bring together a broad mix of industry representatives ranging from OEMs to aftermarket manufacturers, marine retailers, marina operators, industry associations and other parties, the symposium will focus on the future of the marine industry and career development requirements.

As the lack of quality trained marine personnel becomes more prevalent, organizers thought it would be important to initiate an open discussion that would cross multiple industry platforms, with the goal to addressing both short- and long-term employment needs as well as fostering a planning collaboration, said Justin Maley, event organizer and IMT administrator.

Maley has spoken directly to multiple industry businesses and reports the enthusiasm for a training dialog is encouraging.

""The idea for the conference came about simply by learning about the marine industry,"" Maley said.

Prior to becoming a marine technical educator, he worked with Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer KTM AG overseas and in the U.S. ""I came in with my eyes wide open, and was forced to learn from scratch, and start addressing problems that were being brushed aside,"" Maley said, adding he became concerned when he didn't see a larger effort to improve technicians coming out of school.

""I don't want to sound negative, but the marine industry is far behind other industries,"" he said.

""We are hoping this conference will serve a 2-for-1 purpose. We want to help the industry, and learn how we can change it,"" he said."
409,"Alexander Acosta, Another View contributor",4/6/2018 11:06,"America's economy is back and firing on all cylinders.

Gov. Kim Reynolds and I recently visited innovative workforce education programs at Des Moines' Central Campus and Waukee APEX. Our visits also included the Iowa Correctional Institution for Women, where individuals work toward certifications before their transition from incarceration to the workplace.

Governor Reynolds' forward-thinking approach to workforce issues is yielding dividends.

Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.9 percent.

In some parts of the state, unemployment is as low as 1.9 percent.

Iowa's economic boom is reflective of the economic boom underway throughout our nation.

While some focus on distractions, President Donald Trump has been hard at work advancing a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda.

Nationally, nearly 3 million jobs have been created since November 2016.

For the past six months, unemployment has held steady at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.

The unemployment rate for America's veterans in 2017 was 3.7 percent, the lowest level since 2001.

African-American and Hispanic-American unemployment hit their lowest levels ever in 2017.GDP in the fourth quarter of 2017 was nearly 3 percent, a number that many economists never thought we would achieve.

Survey after survey shows that Americans are optimistic about the economy.

Consumer confidence reached its highest point in 14 years, according to the University of Michigan consumer survey.

The Federal Reserve reports that industrial production, manufacturing production, and mining output are trending up.

To date, more than 4 million Americans working from more than 460 companies have received bonuses, raises, 401(k) increases, or other benefits as a result of the president's tax reform.

Across the United States, there are a record 6.3 million open jobs.

That includes about 65,000 open jobs in Iowa.To fill these jobs, we are working with states to roll back burdensome occupational licensing rules and expand apprenticeships.

Millions of Americans already have the skills employers need to fill good, family-sustaining jobs that are currently unfilled.

In some cases, their employment is blocked by excessive and burdensome occupational licensing requirements.

In 1950, only 1 in 20 Americans needed a license to perform their job.

Today, more than 1 in 4 Americans must acquire a license to work and, by the latest count, states and cities license more than 1,100 separate occupations.

I have traveled all over the country encouraging state leaders to eliminate unnecessary licenses, streamline those necessary for health and safety, and pursue reciprocity agreements with neighboring states.

For some Americans, our education system fails to provide skills demanded in growing industries.

This spring, President Trump's Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, which I chair, will issue its report and recommendations for expanding industry-recognized apprenticeships designed to provide job seekers with the demand-driven skills they need to excel in the jobs of today and tomorrow.

The new, industry-recognized apprenticeships will extend to all industries.

They will forge new partnerships among educational institutions, businesses, labor unions, industry associations, and public officials to develop apprenticeships that deliver the skills and experience that American job creators need.

I am grateful for the meaningful contributions Governor Reynolds has made as a member of the Task Force.

From my participation last week in the Future Ready Iowa Summit, I know that Iowans are confronting, head on, the task of job readiness.

A more flexible apprenticeship option will create even more opportunities.

With a lifetime of experience as a job creator, Americans believed that President Trump would jumpstart our economy.

Alexander Acosta serves as the U.S. Secretary of Labor."
410,"Erin Granger, Great Falls College",4/6/2018 13:12,"Great Falls College MSU has partnered with Dick Anderson Construction to offer an apprenticeship program for the company's employees.

About two years ago, Dick Anderson Construction approached Great Falls College MSU looking for ways to train existing employees.

Great Falls College MSU's Center for Lifelong Learning worked with Dick Anderson to build a customized training program that fit the company's needs.

What started as an internal apprenticeship program has now become an official Montana Registered Apprenticeship program.

When employees complete the apprenticeship program they earn a nationally recognized industry credential through the Montana Department of Labor & Industry.

Since 1941, the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program housed within the state Department of Labor & Industry has worked with business sponsors to launch apprenticeship programs and put Montanans to work.

In 2017, the state legislature voted to provide a tax credit to companies offering training programs through the Montana Registered Apprenticeship program.

The program offers on-the-job and classroom training.

The training program recently became an official Montana Registered Apprenticeship.

Apprenticeships are a time-honored tradition of passing on craftsmanship, knowledge, and skills to the next generation in the workplace.

""Today, apprenticeships are putting Montanans to work and expanding talent pipelines for businesses across the state,"" said Department of Labor & Industry Commissioner Galen Hollenbaugh.

Apprenticeships help grow Montana's workforce, while also supporting local economies.

In 2015, the average wage of a registered apprentice was almost $38,000, which is higher than the earnings of a typical working college student.

After completing their training program, apprentices go on to earn significantly higher wages.

""Apprenticeship programs add to Montana's human capital, which promotes economic growth,"" Hollenbaugh said.

Dick Anderson Construction's apprenticeship program has been a great success for the company.

With the help of Great Falls College MSU, they piloted the program in Helena and have since expanded it to Bozeman.

They'll start offering apprenticeships in Great Falls in April and hope to eventually expand to Missoula and Billings.

""They wanted a way to get more of their employees educated without having to leave the workforce and go to school,"" said Heather Palermo, Director of the Center for Lifelong Learning at Great Falls College MSU.Great Falls College MSU worked closely with Dick Anderson Construction to develop a training program that fit the company's specific needs.

""We had to take the training to them,"" said Joel Sims, Trades Division Director at Great Falls College MSU.Every week, a GFC MSU instructor travels to Helena and Bozeman where he teaches a classroom training session for employees.

Employees then worked with Dick Anderson Construction supervisors to do hands-on training and assessments on their job sites.

""We focus the classroom sessions on what the students are working on at the job site,"" Palermo said.

If they are building stairs, the classroom training will teach them the proper technique for stair construction.

For a training program to become Montana Registered Apprenticeship certified it must include 2,000 hours of on-the-job training and related instruction, which is more formalized instruction, often in a classroom.

Dick Anderson Construction could have hired its own trainers to offer the related instruction, but it made more sense for them to partner with a two-year college like Great Falls College MSU.""Two-year colleges are positioned in a way that we already have the structure and materials to offer the related instruction,"" Palermo said.

Palermo and Sims worked with Dick Anderson to make sure the curriculum matched what they wanted their employees to learn.

""Great Falls College has been absolutely wonderful to work with in regards to tailoring the work to be exactly what we want,"" Chase said.

Great Falls College MSU can help businesses with a wide range of apprenticeship programs.

""Apprenticeships aren't just for trades,"" Palermo said.

""There is no set curriculum for an apprenticeship program and that's the awesome part of it.""

Some programs can be structured so students earn college credit and even a college degree or certificate.

Apprenticeship programs don't have to be for-credit.

""We're here to help companies create whatever kind of apprenticeship that works for them,"" Palermo said.

Great Falls College MSU has offered customized training for several years, meaning it develops training programs customized for specific companies.

Working to create an official apprenticeship program is very similar.

""Apprenticeships are not the same for every company or every industry,"" Palermo said.

""We work closely with companies to tailor training to be what they want.""

In addition to giving employees the skills their employer is looking for, apprenticeships also show workers that their employers care about their longevity with the company.

Since starting the program, Chase has seen employees' skill sets improve, but she's also seen a cultural shift amongst workers.

""We have seen a huge attitude change with our employees who are part of the program,"" Chase said."

""This was my chance to start over, a new chapter,"" Mezzio said.

""Some women feel maybe they don't belong and can't do it. We're here to show you women can do it 100 percent.""

Mezzio shared her story with U.S. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro Thursday when the politician toured the union's Cheshire Road training center Friday.

Building Pathways Connecticut is an apprenticeship program that focuses on helping women and minorities break into the construction and industrial careers.

The four-year program is funded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Apprenticeship Grant Program and gives participants the opportunity to gain real work experience, earning essential certificates and preparing for jobs in the industry.

Apprentices get experience in a variety of fields, including machine operation, welding and hydraulics.

""When they graduate from here they are completely prepared,"" said Kurt Westby, deputy commissioner for the state Department of Labor.

For second year apprentice Cynthia Graham, 23, of Terryville, the program provides her the training to operate heavy machinery, a passion.

It's ""The thrill of moving something absolutely huge and building America,"" Graham said.

Apprentices Jasmine Samok, 22, and Susan Kalat, 30, drove two large pieces of equipment over to the garage to meet DeLauro on the tour.

""There's not one day I don't learn something new.""

Kalat, on the other hand, is closer than ever to fulfilling her dream of being a crane operator.

""Heavy equipment is where I knew I always wanted to be,"" Kalat said.

DeLauro hugged the women, praising them for blazing the trail into machine operation.

By partnering with unions, DeLauro said the state can help grow industry once again.

""It was so frustrating to see there was an elimination of apprenticeship programs when it's really the direction we should be going in in the future,"" DeLauro said.

""Apprenticeship programs are a pathway to economic success.""

While Mezzio was happy to have found her career calling, she also expressed gratitude for her union family.

She hopes to be an example to her two adult sons that women can achieve careers in the field.

""I want to show them women can do anything and that we're strong,"" Mezzio said."

Despite peak demand for labor, far too many are missing out on jobs and career advancement because they lack the requisite skills and training.

The reality is clear: The skills gap is not closing rapidly enough for employers or would-be employees.

This is a challenge the private sector, government and educators are working to address.

The pervasive skills gap is the driving force behind the National Network of Business and Industry Associations, which is comprised of 25 organizations reaching more than 775,000 companies in sectors with 84 million employees.

Along multiple fronts, the National Network is identifying and supporting innovative solutions to put the skills gap out of business.

We are particularly energized by a powerful model being employed across the country: Work-and-learn programs are proving to be an ideal approach for a wide array of businesses to meet their current workforce needs, while also building a strong pipeline for the future.

For many unemployed and underemployed Americans, work-and-learn programs offer earning power in the short term, while allowing people to acquire skills that will empower them find their first, next, and better jobs.

Encouragingly, work-and-learn initiatives are also inspiring reforms in traditional seat-time-based educational pathways and institutions, resulting in more graduates who hit the ground running and excel in their chosen fields.

Most people are familiar with work-and-learn programs in the context of the traditional apprenticeship, which has long been a staple of job preparation in many trades.

To provide real value and be a useful model of workforce preparation in sectors well beyond the trades, today's apprenticeships must be demand-driven and directly connected to the needs of the modern workforce.

High quality work-and-learn programs combine theory and hands-on, job-related training with skills assessments, mentorship and paid work with a pathway to employment.

Blended Learning, which melds work and classroom experiences adroitly.

Credit for Prior Knowledge and Experience, such as military service.

Industry Skill Standards and Credentials, to align the experience with employer expectations.

Employment Arrangement, to ensure that participants get real work experience.

An excellent example of work-and-learn in practice is the Kentucky Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education.

KY FAME is a partnership between regional manufacturers and higher education institutions that is creating a new pipeline of highly skilled workers through apprenticeship-style education that leads to career pathways in advanced manufacturing.

Once accepted into the program, students ""Earn and learn"" by attending classes at a Kentucky Community and Technical College location two days a week and spending 24 hours a week with a leading manufacturer for a competitively-paid work experience.

By program's end, students have earned an associate degree in Applied Science in Industrial Technology Maintenance and established good relationships with Kentucky manufacturers.

While businesses across the nation are stepping up to design and implement new work-and-learn programs, government must do its part to reform and modernize its ""Registered Apprenticeship Program."" Employers across industry sectors find the current system, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor and State Apprenticeship Agencies, to be too bureaucratic and costly.

I have joined my colleagues on the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, established by President Trump to equip more Americans with the skills job creators demand, in advocating for these reforms.

With real solutions at hand for businesses, educators and government alike, there is no good reason why the skills gap should continue to plague our economy.

From the president to small businesses, to educators and hard-working Americans striving for a better life, we are in this together and must stay at it until the job is done.

426,BRANDON KLEIN - The Daily Reporter,4/10/2018 1:30,"Stacie Alexander feels a sense of joy when driving past a building where she contributed to its construction.

The first-year plumbing and pipefitting apprentice and a member of Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 189 in central Ohio says she gets more job satisfaction from her work compared with her post-college life in an office setting.

She now works 40 hours a week except every other Monday when she takes a class as part of the apprenticeship program.

""I was really interested in making this a career,"" Alexander said.

She gained inspiration from her father, who worked in the trades.

She also enjoys applying mathematical and technical skills in her work, something she enjoyed while in high school.

""I really do enjoy working with my hands,"" Alexander said.

In 2017, Ohio had a 96-percent increase in the number of women enrolled in its Building Trades' Joint Apprenticeship Training programs, according to Affiliated Construction Trades Ohio.

There were 460 women enrolled in the programs last year compared with 262 out of 8,730 apprentices in 2016.

""The Building Trades offer tremendous opportunities for growth and advancement,"" said Matt Szollosi, executive director of Affiliated Construction Trades Ohio in a statement.

""Both at the local level and here at the state level, we are doing a better job of explaining that those opportunities are available to any person who is willing to work hard.""

Briana Phillips is a fourth-year apprentice and a member of the Iron Workers Local 44 in Cincinnati.

She's one more class from moving up from apprentice to a journeyman.

Phillips, who turned 23 last week, fell in love with welding when she was in 10th grade.

""I just want to be iron worker just like anyone wants to be a doctor,"" Phillips said.

She met much resistance from high school officials, who wanted her to attend college, and the industry itself.

It took her three attempts to get accepted into the apprenticeship program.

It wouldn't have stopped Phillips, who would have gone to another city to get her foot in the trade.

Phillips got into the program and works 40 hours a week and takes night classes, twice a week.

""You make money while you're learning,"" she said.

Just over year ago, Phillips won her union's apprentice competition at the Iron Workers Local 44.

She not only defeated her male counterparts but became the first female ironworker apprentice to compete at the district level.

""The guests were blown away by our young talent,"" said Dave Baker, business manager of Local 44, in a statement at the time.

Both Alexander and Phillips have young families and are able to balance work and life in their respective communities.

Phillips met her boyfriend, who was learning welding in college, and was able to persuade to join the program.

She said sometimes scheduling daycare needs can be challenging but the two are able to manage.

She dreams of starting her own company and getting safety certifications for further advancement.

Alexander, who's now divorced with two kids, said she doesn't have much challenge with balancing family needs.

She works extra hours when she has the opportunity but makes time with her family.

""I'm a family person, so I put my children first,"" she said.

She hopes to see more women get involved with the trades.

""When we're given the opportunity people are pretty impress,"" Alexander said."

Joblessness is often cited as a major factor that contributes to recidivism as well.

One study from the Manhattan Institute found a 20 percent reduction in recidivism when a person found meaningful employment soon after being released.

With more access to nationally accredited trade apprenticeship programs, inmates released from Federal prisons now stand a better chance of starting a career."

Pre-apprenticeships prepare individuals to enter into employment and to succeed in a company's registered apprenticeship program.

WWRC's MTT program is a 16-week, 625-hour curriculum whose foundation is the Manufacturing Skills Institute's Manufacturing Specialist and Manufacturing Technician 1 program, plus OSHA 10 and forklift certifications.

The WWRC training incorporates core skills required for manufacturing or warehouse occupations and contains the soft skills employers want such as communication, problem solving, flexibility, and teamwork.

Hershey registered Hall into a new apprenticeship occupation, a 3000-hour Industrial Manufacturing Technician apprenticeship governed by the Division of Registered Apprenticeship, Virginia Department of Labor and Industry.

Companies who hire from pre-apprenticeship programs gain custom-trained talent to meet their workforce needs, and can potentially save thousands of training dollars as the instruction may be credited toward their registered apprenticeship requirements.

""Pre-apprenticeship opens another avenue for our job candidates to gain work-based training, credentials, and self-sustaining careers and gives employers like Hershey highly qualified employees. It's a win-win for all involved,"" said Dr. Joe Ashley, Assistant Commissioner, Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services.

""Hershey's registration of Chris in this tight labor market represents a growing employer movement to grow-your-own talent and to incorporate people with disabilities into candidate pools,"" said Debby Hopkins, Chief Workforce Officer and V2V Program Director.

""We are delighted with the many employers and partnerships engaged in this project and look forward to more success stories.

The WWRC manufacturing pre-apprenticeship program is supported through a number of state and regional partnerships including funding from the Career Pathways for Individuals with Disabilities Grant and the SVWDB's V2V Apprenticeship Initiative, a $4 Million U.S. Department of Labor grant to expand registered apprenticeship in Virginia and develop apprenticeship pathways for underrepresented populations, including individuals with disabilities.

Several in-depth accounts of the successes of these collaborative programs are available for the public to learn more.

437,State Rep. Jessie Danielson,4/11/2018 16:28,"Every hard-working Coloradans deserve a chance to find a good-paying job.

Many young people in our state - including soon-to-be high school grads - are hungry for an opportunity to work hard, earn a good living and build a secure future for themselves and their family.

For many kids, a four-year college degree is the right path.

Kids should be able to access opportunities to find a good career.

That is why I am pushing to expand vocational technical training programs.

With apprenticeships and vocational education, we can put all students on the path to a good-paying job, even if they aren't going to college.

That's why I am sponsoring HB18-1341; the Apprenticeship and Vocational Technical Training bill.

By expanding access to apprenticeship and vocational technical training opportunities, we are helping connect Coloradans to great careers while growing a workforce that helps Colorado better compete in the global economy.

Right now it is hard for students, career counselors and job hunters to find these opportunities.

HB-1341 fixes that by creating a Colorado state apprenticeship resource directory.

As we work to support more STEM programs in public schools, we can do more by helping connect a future employee to a good-paying industry that gives them real-world, on-the-job training experience.

It may be hard for a student and their family to take on student loan debt, and then graduate into an uncertain future.

On the other hand, many apprenticeships allow students to ""Earn while you learn,"" often paying enrollees while they are in the program, then assisting in job placement in industries where workers are much-needed and can start out earning $60,000+ per year with benefits.

When looking into attending a community college, four year-college, or university, there are lots of publications that serve as guides to help choose the best program and the right fit.

We need that kind of resource to help those young Coloradans who want to get into a stable, good-paying career through an apprenticeship program.

I am working hard to put every Colorado kid on the path to a good-paying job, whether or not they are going to college.

It's vital to Colorado's economic competitiveness that we support apprenticeships and vocational technical training.

It's one commonsense way we can help Colorado families build secure futures for themselves and their kids.

Companies all over the world have become successful because of the way they treat their employees.

Over the years, the company has provided various programs to improve the lives of the workers.

A salubrious work climate means high work productivity.

For most industries, a healthy environment in the workspace equals high-quality products and services.

The company benefits from workers who feel empowered and are just not going to work to earn a paycheck.

Giving these employees the opportunity to change their lives and learn valuable trades and skills can go a long way.

From the moment Phaze Concrete started pouring concrete for driveways and residential projects, the mission statement became clear.

That statement was to treat employees as family and give them control over their careers.

Providing options and programs to improve their families trickles down to their families and quality of work.

For the past ten years, the group has earned the reputation of excellent work in concrete construction but also setting the gold standard in employee treatment.

Employers that treat employees as just workers give off the impression that the staff is there just to ""Earn a paycheck."" For Phaze Concrete, it runs much deeper than that.

The moment a person starts to work for the company, they become a member of the family.

The person becomes given proper training from the first day.

They are also made aware of every opportunity to earn promotions and a higher degree of learning.

The most successful program the company has offered employees is the apprenticeship curriculum.

Not only does the course allow young workers to learn on the job and gain skills in the concrete industry, but they improve their chances of climbing the ladder within the company.

Phaze Concrete has become proud of the fact that several members of their apprenticeship program have become leaders in the company.

Learning different trades and skills can improve the chance of a long career in concrete construction.

The program has grown so successful that the government took notice.

The company partnered with the Department of Labor to spread their findings to other companies and industries around the country.

Explicitly dealing with the Department of Apprenticeships, the company has led the way in spreading awareness.

The success of Phaze Concrete has expanded into different industries too.

To further hammer the point home to companies across the country, Alexander Acosta, the United States Secretary of Labor spoke about the importance of these type of programs.

Talking in front of some of the most important people in the world, Acosta glowed about the program at the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers' Meeting in May 2017.

The word has spread all over the country, and more companies are taking part in a program similar to Phaze Concrete.

Today, Phaze Concrete is one of over 37,000 different apprenticeship programs across the country.

Over 25 young apprentices are a part of Phaze's program.

That's not the only program offered by the company to their employees.

Their GED Readiness Program has improved the lives of many workers and their families.

The program is useful because of the outreach of availability.

Not only can a worker or family member get their GED, they can continue to work and earn a living.

In the end, they receive their GED and a chance to improve their career.

No matter if they decide to stay in the concrete construction industry, their GED unlocks doors that wouldn't be available before passing the test.

The company has become the leader in delivering quality concrete to the construction industry for the past ten years.

448,Mike Lewis,4/12/2018 20:48,"More than 50 business people and educators gathered Thursday to celebrate successes and hear about lessons learned through the Washington County Youth Apprenticeship Program.

The program pairs Washington County students with paid apprenticeships in area businesses.

The purpose is to provide mentoring and training, as well as a progression from school to work opportunities.

Washington County and Frederick County are in the second year of a two-year state pilot program.

""Tonight represents a wonderful opportunity to express the success stories that we have had along the way and to be able to present that to the businesses out in Washington County and to the parents and the students out in Washington County,"" Kelly M. Schulz, the secretary of the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, said before the open house began.

One important lesson, she said, was the importance of building relationships among all of those involved.

""We had the opportunity to learn some very valuable lessons about what it means to be able to create those relationships between industry, the community, the schools, the parents and the students. And I think we learned that lesson really well and we were able to capitalize on some additional funding that we received from the federal government to be able to put a full-time navigator, an apprenticeship navigator, here in the county in order to be able to make those relationships ... concrete.""

That thought was echoed by Peggy Pugh, associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction for Washington County Public Schools.

One lesson, she said, has been learning what businesses need.

""At this point, we have more student interest than we do have businesses,"" she said.

""We're actively recruiting for more businesses, so that we can place students.""

At Thursday's open house, people also heard Becky Willard, owner of the Beacon Grace consulting firm, and Joanie Gerber, president of Bikle Manufacturing, review their experiences of working with apprentices.

A student must complete 450 hours of work-based training and one year of related classroom instruction to complete the program.

The business, among other things, must pay the youths no less than minimum wage."

PARKERSBURG -West Virginia provides free apprenticeship programs to prepare participants for work in well-paying jobs.

Wood County is home to several building trades union apprentice programs, including Carpenters, Plumbers and Pipefitters, Electricians, Laborers, Millwrights, Roofers, Sheet Metal Workers, Iron Workers, Boilermakers and Cement Masons.

Other building trades apprentice programs with training centers are in Huntington, Insulators; Medina, Operating Engineers; Weston, Painters; and Harrisville, Bricklayers.

Some of the local apprentice programs train people from throughout the state.

""Apprenticeships are proven training strategies that help our contractors by creating a highly skilled, productive employee and helps that worker start new careers that offer better wages and benefits,"" said Carl Reynolds, who recently retired as administrator at the West Virginia Laborers' Training Center in Mineral Wells.

""Apprenticeship can help strengthen the local workforce for both the employer and the union,"" Reynolds said, describing it as a ""Win, win"" program.

Photo by Jeffrey Saulton Eric Tingler Jesse Rhodes, middle, and Alicia Woods work on a door frame at the Iron Workers training center in Parkersburg.

""Apprenticeship is a blueprint to success,"" Reynolds said.

The West Virginia Laborers' Training Center in Mineral Wells has 11 classrooms with three large training bays inside.

Students learn building construction, heavy/highway and utility construction, masonry, demolition, deconstruction, pipeline, tunneling and environmental remediation.

From 20-100 students a day participate at the Laborers' Training Center in Mineral Wells, which is on 170 acres, Reynolds said.

Students receive three meals a day and can live in a facility that houses up to 36 students.

Participants receive classroom and hands-on training in becoming a construction craft laborer.

Photo by Jeffrey Saulton Eric Tingler and Jesse Rhodes work on a door frame at the Iron Workers training center in Parkersburg.

It is ""Real-world learning,"" Reynolds said of the apprentice programs.

Some apprenticeship programs can last four to five years, Reynolds said.

They get to learn while working on a construction job and are trained on modern equipment and with new technology, he said.

Reynolds said there is a high demand for quality laborers in West Virginia.

He mentioned the need for skilled laborers in road construction, pipeline work and school construction.

Those seeking to enter an apprenticeship program should get applications through the Workforce West Virginia Employment Service Office.

The apprenticeship program has certified instructors who have national certification.

There are about 50 union contractors in commercial and industrial work who hire workers from the local union halls, said Clint Suggs, executive director of the Parkersburg-Marietta Contractors Association.

The apprentice programs help these contractors and the owners find trained, quality workers, Suggs said.

The contractors pay for the apprentice programs through benefit contributions.

Suggs has talked to local high school students about the apprenticeship programs.

These apprenticeships are U.S. Department of Labor-approved programs, which means they are registered with the state, have trust documents and apprenticeship standards, and are managed by a joint committee of labor and management trustees, Suggs said.

""Most apprenticeship programs run four years, although some may be longer,"" Suggs said.

""Apprentices will learn work ethics as well as all of the skills required to master their trade. They are held accountable to the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee to attend class, go to work every day and on time, and to pass annual as well as random drug tests,"" Suggs said.

A contractor that is signatory to the building trades doesn't have to carry a craftsperson on his payroll year-round, only when he needs them, Suggs said.

With building trades craftsmen, contractors and owners realize they are getting well-trained, skilled, safe workers that want to get the job done right the first time, Suggs said.

""It's a proven business model that works well for many,"" Suggs said.

Alicia Woods of Wood County is a student in the Iron Workers apprenticeship program in Parkersburg.

""I don't want to sit at a desk. I like working with my hands,"" Woods said.

""I want to work with my hands, that's the best fit for me,"" she said in describing why she entered the apprenticeship program.

Even though she had not graduated from the program, Woods is on the job, putting her new skills to use.

""I'm working at Sherwood right now in Doddridge County,"" she said.

Woods said the field is wide open for more and more people who want to go to work.

""This is great for someone who likes to work hard; it's not sitting at a desk,"" she said."
457,Kerry Hannon,4/15/2018 21:00,"After Hannah Grey of Pittsburgh earned an undergraduate degree in interior design, she spent several years working for an architectural firm as a commercial interior designer.

""I enjoyed it,"" she said, ""But it was definitely more of a desk job.""

""The basis of the program was to show us how the blueprints we design actually translate to real life,"" said Grey, 38.

""It was a fun thing I did with him, working with my hands and helping him fix things,"" she said.

So in 2014 she decided to pursue a career as a carpenter, and she is now on the cusp of completing her fourth year in a carpentry apprentice program at the Keystone Mountain Lakes Regional Council of Carpenters in Pittsburgh.

Her skills fit the job: She is detail-oriented, which is crucial to making accurate cuts.

""I have met a lot of people in the program who have college degrees, worked in office jobs and have decided to do this,"" Grey said.

A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that growth in the economy and population would increase demand for new buildings, roads and other structures, which would create jobs in construction and extraction occupations.

That translates to a need for workers who have these skills in many regions across the country.

""They got out and worked for a few years and determined they didn't like what they were doing or realized there was no real upside future,"" he said.

Most transitioning workers learn the trade through an apprenticeship.

These programs generally run from three to five years, based on a 2,000-hour year.

That breaks down to 10 percent in the classroom, or 200 hours a year, where apprentices learn specific trade skills along with local building codes, blueprint reading, mathematics and more.

The bulk of their time, 1,800 hours, is on the job, Nobers said.

There are people at all ages going through a career with a mundane job who have been unexcited about going into work and are looking at these skilled-trade jobs with increasing interest, said Bryan Kamm, a workforce consultant who is leading an apprenticeship program in Florida's Cape Kennedy area called the Space Coast Consortium Apprenticeship Initiative.

""These manufacturing apprenticeships are no longer blue-collar work,"" Kamm said, ""But require highly technically advanced skills that include a great command of mathematics, physics, hydraulics, roboticsand information technology.""

U.S. employers have been saying for years that they have a tough time finding workers to fill many skilled blue-collar jobs.

A 2015 report from the Manufacturing Institute, for example, found that 7 out of 10 executives reported shortages of workers with adequate technology, computer and technical training skills.

By 2025, nearly 3 1/2 million manufacturing jobs will likely need to be filled, and the skills gap is expected to result in 2 million of those jobs going unfilled, according to the analysis.

New construction, building maintenance and the repair of homes and offices are expected to drive demand for these workers.

There is not a lot of hard data to suggest a big shift from white-collar workers into blue-collar jobs, but there is a strong push to recruit them.

""If you talk to manufacturers, they will tell you they are working hard to change the image of manufacturing jobs from dirty, dangerous jobs to being quasi-white collar,"" said Paul Osterman, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-director of the MIT Sloan Institute for Work and Employment Research.

""And today many of these workers need to be skilled with computers and statistical quality control processes. In some sense, manufacturing looks a lot more white-collar-ish than it used to.""

""You've got to have some transferability between the skills you did in one job that transfer to the next job,"" Carnevale said.

""For most people, there is very little transfer between white-collar work and, say, plumbing. There is some transferability, but it's rare.""

After college he worked as a credit analyst, but he said he was miserable crunching numbers on a spreadsheet all day and sitting in a cubicle.

He landed the job at RG Manufacturing and Machining in Machesney Park, Illinois, and soon enrolled in the employer-sponsored apprenticeship program.

He takes classes each weeknight in topics such as blueprint reading and AutoCAD at Rock Valley College, along with 20 other apprentices in the Rock River Valley Tooling & Machining Association program.

Grey said that as a college graduate and someone who had a job at an architecture firm, she was very proud to tell people that this is what a woman in construction looks like.

STARTING FRESH WITHOUT STARTING OVER. For Susan Golden, 64, flinging on a backpack filled with books and rambling around the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California, for a year in 2016 was ""Like drinking from a fire hose,"" she said.

Each academic year 25 fellows, who have had two or three decades of a successful career, are selected to attend the program and to enroll in classes across the university.

""For me, the program was an ideal way to restart my career,"" she said.

Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative, a yearlong program for corporate executives and professionals interested in applying their skills to social problems, operates with a similar concept.

The program's fellows get to audit courses at the university and its graduate schools and develop independent projects with professors and fellow students.

Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor who is director of the leadership initiative, said the program was started ""To deploy a new leadership force of people transitioning from their main career to their next years of service.""

Todd Fisher, 52, a fellow in Harvard's program, was ready for a new challenge.

When Fisher turned 50, he heard about the program and started to make his plan.

In addition to the Stanford and Harvard programs, there are a handful of other educational programs for Gen Xers and baby boomers eyeing a second act.

Later this year, for example, the University of Notre Dame will start the Inspired Leadership Initiative, a one-year program for ""Accomplished leaders at the end of their careers.""

The University of Texas at Austin will also welcome later this year its first cadre for its nine-month Tower Fellows Program for those who ""Have built a career of major accomplishments and who now seek to deepen their knowledge and/or embrace new fields."""

""As Iowans continue to train for the jobs of today and tomorrow, salaries will also rise. That's why Future Ready Iowa is so critical to our state's future.""

Future Ready Iowa is Iowa's plan to train Iowans for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

The goal of Future Ready Iowa is 70 percent of Iowa workers having education or training beyond high school by 2025.

In order to reach that goal, another 127,700 Iowans need to earn post-secondary degrees or other credentials.

The statewide Laborshed report shows that over three-fifths of employed respondents indicated they have completed education or training beyond high school.

This statistic has been trending upward since 2008 in the annual statewide Laborshed reports and increased.

Beth Townsend, Director of Iowa Workforce Development, encourages Iowans who would like to re-enter the workforce to use the services of the IowaWORKS Centers around the state.

""Numerous services are available at no cost at our IowaWORKS Centers including career assessments, skill assessments, resume and interviewing help as well as workshops and classes,"" Director Townsend said.

""We can also help determine if job seekers qualify for funding to receive training. We want to help Iowans find and keep high quality jobs.""

Three websites also are available to help Iowa job seekers in their career exploration: futurereadyiowa.

The Future Ready Iowa website features Career Coach, which allows users to learn about different careers and what suits their interests, see how much each job pays in their area, determine if the job is in high-demand, find out what kind of education or training the job requires, search job openings, and build a resume.

The eight new teams join more than one hundred pairs of masters and apprentices who have taken part in the Apprenticeship Program since its inception in 2002.

On Sunday, May 6., from 12:00 to 5:00 PM, the Virginia Folklife Program will partner with James Monroe's Highland to host the Folklife Apprenticeship Showcase at the historic home of James Monroe.

Now in its fifteenth year, the Showcase is a free, family-friendly event that celebrates the traditional music, crafts, and foodways of Virginia, introducing the public to the master artists and apprentices who keep the traditions alive.

At the Apprenticeship Showcase on Sunday, May 6., audiences will enjoy more than ten live musical performances and a dazzling display of engaging demonstrations.

Special guests include the Twin Creeks Stringband, one of Southwest Virginia's finest old-time bands, among many others.

Featured foods include real Brunswick stew by the Proclamation Stew Crew, a ""Soul supper"" prepared by the Ingram Family of Richmond, fried apple pies from Frances Davis, and oysters shucked by world champion oyster shucking sisters, Deborah Pratt and Clementine Macon Boyd.

""Through this unique program, we work with incredibly accomplished musicians and craftspeople who are dedicated to passing along vitally important art forms to future generations,"" said Jon Lohman, Virginia State Folklorist and director of the Virginia Folklife Program.

""Participants in this year's showcase exemplify the remarkable range and diversity of folk traditions in Virginia.""

The Virginia Folklife Apprenticeship Program pairs experienced master artists with gifted apprentices for one-on-one, nine-month learning experiences, ensuring that art forms are passed on in ways that are conscious of history and faithful to tradition.

More than workshops or lessons, apprenticeship learning takes place in the art forms' traditional contexts, calling upon the complete engagement of the senses and contextualizing the practices within the larger cultural landscape.

The Virginia Folklife Program, a public program of Virginia Humanities, is dedicated to the documentation, presentation, support, and celebration of Virginia's rich cultural heritage.

For more than twenty-five years, the program has documented the Commonwealth's music and material traditions and shared those histories through hands-on workshops, performances, exhibitions, audio and video recordings, and apprenticeships across Virginia.

Virginia Humanities connects people and ideas to explore the human experience and inspire cultural engagement.

As the state humanities council, Virginia Humanities reaches an estimated annual audience of 41 million through community programs and festivals, grants and fellowships, websites and digital initiatives, publications and teacher institutes, radio programs and podcasts, and the Virginia Center for the Book.

460,Staff,4/16/2018 8:13,"Programs that lead future barbers, painters, coders, and laboratory technicians through pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs received grants, Philadelphia Works announced last week.

The local grants, awarded to 12 organizations for both capacity building and pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs April 9 total $1 million.

About a third of the funding was allocated to five building trades, most of whom rarely get these kinds of grants.

""These grants will allow them to recruit more heavily for non-traditional workers, such as women and minorities,"" said Tony Wigglesworth, executive director of the Philadelphia Area Labor Management Committee, a nonprofit that works with the region's building trades.

""It'll give them the resources to do more outreach.""

Building trades have traditionally operated apprenticeship programs, funded by contributions from employers and journeymen workers.

These grants will allow the unions to develop pre-apprentice programs and to use the funding to build capacity.

One of the recipients, the Finishing Trades Institute, can confer college credits.

It is operated by District 21 of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.

""Apprenticeship is extremely beneficial to the employer and the apprentice,"" said Cheryl Feldman, executive director of the District 1199C Training & Upgrading Fund, which has developed nontraditional apprenticeship programs for behavioral health support staff and early childhood educators.

The Training Fund received an $85,000 grant for apprentice and pre-apprentice programs and a$50,000 capacity building grant.

""Rather than hiring someone off the street"" who may not be a good match for the job, employers can shape the training, she said.

""For the apprentice, there is the opportunity to become employed in a position for which they may not have qualified and earn wages while learning the skills and competencies to become fully qualified.""

Like the Training Fund, the Delaware Valley Association for the Education of Young Children also works with apprenticeship programs to train early childhood educators.

The Association, which received a $49,600 capacity building grant, focuses on training classroom teachers who mentor early childhood education apprentices.

With the training, ""These mentors are becoming master teachers and are able to coach other teachers in their programs,"" in addition to the apprentices they are supervising, said Carol Austin, executive director.

Apprenticeships differ from internships or shadowing experiences in that they must be registered with the state or federal government.

To qualify, the course of study must be approved and the program must include a certain amount of hours of classroom and supervised on-the-job training.

The apprentice is a paid employee from the start and receives regular wage increases as skills build.

""In Philadelphia, there is a rising tide of organizations and industries that now see the value of building viable career pathways to find and recruit talented employees,"" Philadelphia Works Chief Executive H. Patrick Clancy said in a statement.

The $1 million in grants awarded to local agencies through Philadelphia Works is part of $3.5 million in workforce dollars distributed by the state to area workforce investments boards, including Philadelphia Works.

That money, in turn, is part of the $50 million PAsmart career pathways program proposed Gov. Wolf earlier this year.

""Apprenticeships are incredibly important, as they connect the people who want to learn new career skills with the companies and industries that need highly trained employees,"" Gov. Wolf said in a statement.

""We propose to invest a total of $50 million in PAsmart, including $7 million to help double the number of registered apprentices in the commonwealth by 2025."".

470,St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment,4/17/2018 17:48,"Individuals with disabilities living in St. Louis and the bi-state metro area now have new career path to certification and employment.

The St. Louis Agency on Training and Employment, in partnership with Challenge Unlimited, Inc., announces the launch of an innovative U.S. Department of Labor Registered Apprenticeship Program to provide people with disabilities a unique opportunity for training and certification to secure janitorial jobs.

The new Apprenticeship was announced at St. Louis City Hall on April 6, 2018, where Mayor Lyda Krewson warmly acknowledged Challenge Unlimited and the significance of this new program for people with disabilities as ""An opportunity to earn a living for themselves and their families, while feeling pride from work."" Challenge Unlimited was then presented with a special plaque of recognition from the Department of Labor.

""We are proud to partner with Challenge Unlimited and the U.S. Department of Labor to provide people with disabilities living in our area with this valuable opportunity,"" she said.

""We never miss an opportunity to offer hope and encouragement to our community along their journey to better lives.""

The newly-established apprenticeship program provides hands-on professional development and additional skills training to individuals with disabilities who are interested in custodial / janitorial employment.

Program participants will be placed on a Cleaning Industry Management Standard certified janitorial contract and are offered the opportunity to achieve training certifications through both the CIMS training programs and the Challenge Unlimited Department of Labor Registered Apprenticeship certification program.

Participants can also receive assistance in identifying job preferences, interview preparation, and securing employment.

""This groundbreaking apprenticeship program will impact hundreds of individuals with disabilities in our region and across multiple states,"" said Charlotte Hammond, President and CEO of Challenge Unlimited.

""This employment program will provide education and training opportunities to create a more defined career path for individuals with disabilities. With support from organizations like SLATE, we are working together to build a well-trained workforce that meets the needs of the janitorial industry.""

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 10% growth in the field of janitorial services over the next decade, an industry that services nearly every facility - from hospitals and schools, to office buildings and event spaces.

Workers in this field have a broad skill set, which can include administrative, customer relations, equipment and building repair, while ensuring safety and compliance for their clientele.

The team at SLATE will be responsible for identifying qualified individuals interested in joining the custodial workforce, as well as providing access to funding for training and supportive services.

These resources create a truly robust opportunity for people with disabilities on both sides of the river seeking employment in this vital service field.

SLATE demonstrates its commitment to citizens with disabilities through its all-accessible offices, partnerships with the Missouri Department of Vocational Rehabilitation and community organizations serving people with disabilities, and - most notably, through its annual initiative Accommodation for Success, a reverse job fair and educational event which educates employers about the benefits of hiring diverse workforce, hosted by SLATE in August since 2015.

Challenge Unlimited has been a primary supporter and contributor to Accommodation for Success since its inception.

This new partnership with Challenge Unlimited expands SLATE's capacity to offer customers with disabilities opportunities to start or advance their careers for competitive employment to customers with disabilities, while increasing their community visibility and participation.

Individuals with disabilities who are interested in obtaining certification for custodial / janitorial employment and consideration for opportunities with Challenge Unlimited are invited to visit SLATE at 1520 Market Street in downtown St. Louis, or call 589-8000 to learn more about the program.

Auxiliary aids and services are available upon request to individuals with disabilities.

Future job openings at Challenge Unlimited will be posted on Missouri Job Portal, at jobs."
471,Emily White,4/18/2018 0:00,"The U.S. unemployment rate has been relatively low for close to six months, with the average rate hovering at 4.1 percent.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that some groups have higher rates of unemployment than others.

Some states have higher than the average unemployment rates, while others are well under the average rate.

Hawaii has the lowest unemployment rate at 2.1 percent, and Alaska's 7.3 percent is the highest.

Four states are right at the 4.1 percent average: Kentucky, Montana, Oklahoma, and Oregon.

The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council estimates that U.S. firms with less than 20 workers account for over 89 percent of businesses.

How are some states encouraging small employers to increase employment opportunities? Here's a round-up.

The Full Employment Credit allows firms with 50 or fewer employees that create new jobs paying more than $10 an hour to take a credit of $1,000 when the new employee completes 12 months of consecutive employment.

There are also credits for hiring a recently deployed unemployed veteran and for creating new jobs.

Small employers in Idaho can take a credit for creating new jobs.

Employers must make capital investments of at least $500,000 in new facilities and increase employment by a minimum of 10 employees earning at least $19.23 and benefits.

If the number of new employees increases to over 10, the average wage can be $15.50.

An additional credit is available to small employers that invest in new plants and buildings.

Small businesses with up to 20 employees may qualify for the Maine Wellness Programs Credit.

Qualified programs include health education programs; behavioral change programs, such as nutrition, stress management, or smoking cessation counseling or seminars; and employee incentive awards for engaging in regular physical activity.

Maryland small business employers can qualify for a tax credit when hiring veterans.

The Hire Our Veterans tax credit is 30 percent of the first $6,000 of wages the firm pays qualified veterans during their first year of employment.

To be qualified, the veteran must have been hired on or after Jan. 1, 2017, among other qualifications.

In Missouri, small businesses are eligible for the disabled access tax credit if their gross receipts do not exceed $1 million or they did not employ more than 30 full-time employees.

If the business had expenditures that exceed the $10,250 federal credit limit, the business can take a state income tax credit of up to 50 percent of eligible expenditures, up to $5,000 a year.

Beginning in 2018, Montana employers may apply for a tax credit for new positions that offer the worker on-the-job training.

The Apprenticeship Tax Credit equals $750 for each apprentice.

Taxpayers must seek approval from the Department of Labor and Industry to claim the credit.

Utah offers a credit to employers who hire a homeless person.

The employer must certify that the hired person meets the definition of homeless and that the employer paid at least $4,000 in wages during two calendar quarters in which the hire occurred.

Any qualified business creating fewer than 20 new jobs for a regular business and fewer than 10 jobs for a qualified small business is eligible for a tax credit of $3,000 annually for five years for each job created.

Qualified businesses are businesses engaged in manufacturing, information processing, warehousing, non-retail goods distribution, qualified research and development, or destination-oriented recreation and tourism."
473,Mark Klaas,4/18/2018 12:30,"Mark Weissenbuehler admits he is no longer exclusively an in-it-for-the-money entrepreneur, determined to rapidly grow his business.

Instead, he finds his satisfaction watching young employees grow, especially fledgling apprentices as they learn a craft from the seasoned guys on the big floor of his manufacturing plant in Pacific.

""Not one of those apprentices knew how to read a tape measure when they came in here, and now they're running hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of machinery,"" Weissenbuehler told Gov. Jay Inslee last Friday, before they toured work stations at American Structures & Design, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of aluminum railing, balcony and sunshade systems.

""They're making parts that make us hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's the exciting thing today, watching these kids.""

""It's really a rush to see that happen,"" Weissenbuehler added.

Weissenbuehler's company has benefited from its participation in Washington's Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee program, which allows young apprentices to graduate from high school with college credit, a journey-level production technician credential, and approximately $28,000 in wages over the 2,000-hour, advanced-manufacturing apprenticeship.

The apprenticeship program is important to employers like Weissenbuehler, as they look to bridge the skills gap.

Manufacturers face the challenge of finding and filling jobs with skilled workers.

For many companies, an increase in impending retirements, emerging technologies, and a greater production demand have created challenges for building a skilled, 21st century workforce.

April marks one year since the launch of the youth apprenticeship program, which combines traditional classroom learning and paid, on-the-job training for high school students.

Inslee ushered in the Career Connect Washington Task Force last year to map out the state's next steps to expand the apprenticeship program.

School districts, community colleges and technical schools are partnering with companies in the program.

Auburn schools have yet to join the network, but AJAC leaders are exploring a wider recruiting reach.

""We're focusing on creating more opportunities to connect young people with great careers,"" Inslee said.

""We know that a four-year track is not the only way to succeed in our state. And for too long, we have been creating this implicit tacit message to our youth.""

Weissenbuehler recognizes that apprenticeship is a good pipeline to find and train employees.

""Not every kid in high school is going off to college,"" he said.

""And here they learn a craft and a trade that they can apply for any job in the world.""

The challenge, Weissenbuehler said, is to motivate and keep young employees engaged.

""We may lose them, but we leave them with skills,"" he said.

""We are doing our part. We help make them mature adults, know how to make a living for themselves and their families, and are able to go elsewhere and still retain a job and support themselves.""

In addition to obtaining journey-level certification as a master tradesperson, the AJAC program sets the apprentice on a path toward an associate's degree that can articulate into a four-year degree.

The apprenticeship program has served Tacoma's Sean Colyer well.

""It's not like having a job at McDonald's,"" he said.

""It's a career path, which is very cool.""

Seth Hamilton enjoys learning the intricacies of being a computer numerically controlled machinist, making parts for general assembly.

The program has given him the foundation to a marketable career.

""Everything's above par.""

Weissenbuehler credits his employees for being willing to work with apprentices daily on the floor.

The young hands have brought energy, enthusiasm and potential to the workplace.

""The future is these young guys. There's no question about it in our minds,"" Weissenbuehler said.

""We need more of these guys. We're excited to see how these young guys are growing.""

Seth Hamilton explains a part he generated as a computer numerically controlled machinist apprentice during the governor's tour of American Structures Design, Inc., in Pacific last Friday.

477,Liz Bell,4/19/2018 11:13,"More than 600 employers across the state pay apprentices who learn specialized skills in the workplace and earn certification through coursework.

""There's still a lot more to be done,"" said Castelloes, who runs the program under the N.C. Community Colleges system.

Castelloes said its annual conference, hosted in Durham last Thursday and Friday with around 200 attendees, is evidence of growing interest around the model which aims to equip a workforce to meet employers' needs.

Representatives from different industries and levels of the education system shared what works in their own communities and exchanged ideas about how to expand the program's reach.

Since 1939, the program has been housed under different departments with different names.

For the past year, ApprenticeshipNC has hosted regional summits across the state to spread the word and start new partnerships.

Castelloes said the recent conference happened because of requests from employers and educators as they travelled the state.

The apprenticeship model, embedded in Switzerland's educational system, is gaining popularity across the country as a way to build the talent pools industries need and provide a low-cost career opportunity for post-secondary attainment.

In 2015, top government officials from Switzerland and the United States signed a Joint Declaration of Intent on Vocational Education and Training to encourage further collaboration around apprenticeships.

Higher Education at the Swiss Embassy, said there has been heightened interest in the apprenticeship model since the Great Recession.

Marti has held his position for two years, and during that time, organizations, governors, and stakeholders have reached out to learn about apprenticeships and vocational education.

Last year, his office organized trips to see the model in practice in Switzerland for the governors of Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Washington.

The Trump administration approved a $50 million increase in funding for apprenticeships in March's omnibus spending bill and an additional $75 million in CTE programs.

Pamela Howze, an advocate for apprenticeships for The National Fund, said there are four other ""Major bills"" with bipartisan support in play seeking apprenticeship funding.

""There's a lot going on with private funders; there's a lot going on with public funding,"" Howze said.

The classroom instruction is often completed through local community colleges but the specific partnership depends on the employer's needs.

""We can have every person in the state wanting to do apprenticeship, but if we don't have employers willing to offer it, it's a moot point,"" Castelloes said.

""So the main focus is to get employers, 'What do you need? What is your skills gap? What are your pressure points and how can we work to alleviate those pressure points and alleviate those skills gaps?'"".

Crystal Folger-Hawks, a career coach with Surry County Schools and Surry Community College, started an internship program last year which she hopes will become a full apprenticeship program, registered through the state and meeting its standards.

Castelloes said smaller businesses often think apprenticeships will be too complex and difficult to manage or are worried that apprenticeships are tied to unionization.

Folger-Hawks worked with the local community college and K-12 system to create a program from the ground-up, funded by a $300,000 grant from the Golden Leaf Foundation.

She said she wanted to prove the value of apprenticeships to the local business community before they were fully on board.

""We were telling the businesses, 'You don't have to put in anything,'"" Folger-Hawks said.

The program started this school year with a cohort of 12 high school students, selected based on aptitude tests and interviews with Folger-Hawks and the business partners.

Many students received soft skills training through the community college before the start of their internships.

Nine of the 12 internships provided participants with an hourly wage, and two of the businesses are working to set up registered apprenticeships for the future.

""Once they saw the type of students we were placing with them, they said, 'We want to pay them because they are being productive,'"" Folger-Hawks said.

One student was offered a full-time position, others were offered part-time jobs, and other students changed career paths based on their internship experience.

She is starting the selection process for next year's cohort which will have 20 students.

""The parents are so interested in this program,"" Folger-Hawks said.

""Getting their child a job - I mean, nothing's wrong with traditional high school jobs, but a job that they're making a decent wage at, and they're getting skills, and they're building their resume. and they're able to bring in a salary to their family - has been huge for a rural community.""

For Kristey Stewart, an operations coordinator at Atlantic Corporate Contracting, a construction company based in Raleigh and Durham, the appeal from the industry side was obvious when she started in her position two years ago.

With eight apprentices working across four companies and taking courses at Durham Technical Community College, Stewart said the program has seen success in the last two years.

""In my industry alone, there are numerous pathways, career pathways, that the students and parents do not know about. And I certainly am an advocate for continuing education no matter how the students get that, whether it be a four-year university or an apprenticeship through certifications.""

Marti likes to emphasize the ""Permeability"" of the Swiss educational system.

He said the model cannot be directly copied from one country to another because the overall systems are so different.

Around 70 percent of students in Switzerland go into apprenticeships after school ends at ninth grade.

Students have the option to go to college after a three to four-year apprenticeship.

Marti said apprenticeships are a normalized part of the system and students do not have to choose between between apprenticeship and higher education.

""You can really move on and around in this system your entire life,"" Marti said."

Hill is working and being trained in several aspects of making furniture at Beachley, said Ed Doub, the company's vice president of upholstery operations.

The company's client list ranges from American Airlines to Hilton, Starbucks and VISA. ""Everything we make here is custom,"" Doub said, referring to the company's commercial-furniture operation on North Prospect Street in Hagerstown.

Hill, an 18-year-old senior at Clear Spring High School, said he hasn't worked with tools much outside of shop classes.

He is spending most afternoons at the 130-year-old furniture company.

He has completed most of his high-school coursework, and is one of several students taking part in the Youth Apprenticeship Maryland program.

Youth Apprenticeship Maryland was formed under the direction of Gov. Larry Hogan ""To aid in creating a pipeline of skilled and qualified labor in both traditional and nontraditional fields by combining on-the-job training and related classroom instruction to eligible high school students."" Public schools in Washington and Frederick counties are serving as pilot programs.

The idea is to help students learn skills and help businesses generate potential employees.

The program is for juniors and seniors ages 16 and older.

They have to complete 450 hours of work-based training and one year of related classroom instruction by Aug. 31 after graduation from high school, according to the Washington County Public Schools' website.

Among other things, a business must provide a qualified mentor, sign a youth-apprenticeship agreement and pay the apprentice.

A business also has to anticipate future entry-level job openings.

""It's kind of another pathway for students,"" said Jeremy Brown, youth-apprenticeship teacher coordinator for Frederick County Public Schools.

Apprenticeships traditionally have been used to train people for trades, such as plumbing or carpentry.

Franklin County, Pa., for example, is looking to add employers in areas such as computer software and biosciences.

""It's educating the employers as well"" on what they can glean from the program, Brown said.

Brown and Wendy Moore, apprenticeship coordinator for career and technology education for Washington County Public Schools, said fewer than a dozen students have apprenticeship roles in each of their programs.

""We have a lot of student interest,"" Moore said.

""We're really looking for employers to come on board.""

Moore said the program is built with a variety of employers in mind.

It includes a waiver so students can work with the necessary tools and machinery.

""It allows them to do a little bit more than they would normally do,"" he said.

The school systems get information from students interested in participating, advertise apprenticeship openings to students, take applications and submit them to employers.

""The employers follow their regular process,"" Moore said.

That process brought Hill to Beachley Furniture, said Mandy Fiery, the company's director of human resources.

""It's been really great teaming up with the Washington County Public Schools,"" she said.

""We need it desperately,"" she said of the apprenticeship program, noting that few people seem to realize the opportunities for employment in area manufacturing.

""It's really difficult to get people, especially the younger generation, excited about it. ... A lot of them have no idea what we're all about.""

""He's got a good attitude.""

Fiery said she ""Can't guarantee a job to anyone."" But she added that Hill is learning skills that he can use elsewhere if he doesn't land at Beachley.

On a recent afternoon, Hill was measuring and slicing sheets of foam cushion to fit furniture frames.

For some larger pieces, he used a special spray adhesive to glue together various shapes of foam.

More demanding pieces call for custom cuts, shaping curves and wedges that have to fit.

Doub, vice president of upholstery operations, agreed.

On the commercial side, many people are cross-trained at different tasks, from working with springs to covering the items with different types of upholstery.

Because it is all custom work, he said, different jobs require different skills.

""That's why we want to expose to a little bit of everything,"" Doub said.

While it is too early to tell, he can see a future for himself in furniture.

""If they offer me a job, I'll probably take it,"" he said."

502,"Martha Ross, Kimberly Hauge",4/23/2018 15:20,"Apprenticeship has a strong bipartisan appeal as part of the solution to current and future workforce challenges.

President Trump released an executive order to expand apprenticeship in 2017 and created a task force to support that expansion.

More recently, the bipartisan Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2018 increased federal funding for apprenticeship.

Efforts seeded by the Obama administration continue to support the growth of apprenticeship at the state and local levels.

In 2018, eight governors, including Republicans and Democrats, specifically referenced apprenticeship in their State of the State Address as a workforce strategy, and many more referenced the value of work-based learning.

It is certainly good news that more policymakers are on board with expanding apprenticeship, but since the whole point of apprenticeship is to provide paid, work-based learning experiences, more employers need to get on board as well.

The research is clear that apprenticeship programs benefit both workers and businesses.

By combining classroom instruction with paid, on-the-job training under the guidance of a mentor, apprenticeship programs help workers gain valuable skills leading to good jobs and careers, and help employers meet their workforce needs, streamline the hiring process, and reduce attrition.

An oft-cited report from the U.S. Department of Commerce and Case Western Reserve University found that apprenticeship programs produced returns on investment of 40 to 50 percent.

Other research found that participants in apprenticeship programs have substantially higher earnings relative to nonparticipants.

At a time when American employers say they can't find workers with the skills they need, and job seekers say they can't find good jobs, apprenticeships can be part of the solution.

The size and scope of apprenticeship programs in the United States are limited.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, there are just over 440,000 active apprentices as of September 30, 2017.

A small fraction of the American population participate in apprenticeship programs compared to other developed countries.

Public policy can support apprenticeships, and educational institutions and unions can be crucial partners, but the threshold criteria for an apprenticeship to succeed are an employer with a job, coupled with a willingness to invest time and money in developing their employees.

Research and experience shows that many employers do not have well-developed internal systems to find and develop talent.

Human resources operations are often more operational than strategic, focusing on payroll, on-boarding, and compliance.

Companies do not always have the capacity to identify current and future skill needs, target their recruitment efforts more strategically, or carry out succession planning.

The benefits of apprenticeship are not always clear to employers, or at least may seem abstract compared to the up-front work of creating such a program.

Running an apprenticeship program that requires longer-term strategies and resources can be difficult for employers.

The good news is that employers do not need to run apprenticeship programs entirely on their own.

By developing policies and incentives to support apprenticeship, states play a significant role in bringing together partners to develop solutions that help their residents find good jobs and their businesses find good workers.

The South Carolina Technical College System runs Apprenticeship Carolina, which features a small team of apprenticeship consultants who support employers through the registration process and help them take advantage of tax credits and other financial incentives.

The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development has Apprenticeship Training Representatives who are available to provide businesses with one-on-one technical assistance.

Other states are also creating more robust linkages between education, workforce, and industry.

In 2017, Washington Governor Jay Inslee created the Career Connect Washington Task Force, co-chaired by the president of Microsoft and the chair of the Washington Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board.

The task force provided recommendations to Governor Inslee that included expanding pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeship, and youth apprenticeship programs.

Montana Governor Steve Bullock created a joint liaison between the state's labor agency and university system to ensure a better alignment of content taught in schools and skills employers need.

This alignment, in combination with a tax credit awarded to businesses that hire apprentices, helped the state grow its apprenticeship programs by 30 percent in the past five years.

To continue being part of the solution to addressing current and future workforce challenges, employers must be willing and able to operate differently.

As a manufacturing executive who helped develop the Kentucky FAME training program explained, ""The employers were such a part of the problem for so long. All we did was complain, but we never jumped in to tell people what we needed.""

The key to apprenticeship expansion is enabling and equipping employers to be the drivers.

This means that federal, state, and local actors in the public and social sectors must also be willing to operate differently.

The examples cited above show that many are willing to do so.

In short, while apprenticeship programs require time and effort to develop, the results are worth the effort."
504,Staff,4/23/2018 20:06,"BRATTLEBORO - This summer, Strolling of the Heifers will offer the annual Farm-to-Table Culinary Apprenticeship program, in which up to 12 people will receive training that can lead to permanent food-preparation positions at restaurants and institutional kitchens and careers in the culinary field.

The program is free to participants who meet income and employment status qualifications, including veterans.

It includes classroom time, as well as on-the-job experience at restaurants and institutional kitchens, for which participants will be paid.

The aim of the program, said Orly Munzing, founder and executive director of Strolling of the Heifers, is to place all participants into permanent culinary employment at the end of the program.

""If a participant is successful at completing the coursework, we're pretty sure we can successfully place that person.""

The program is in its fourth year and has been successful at placing graduates in full-time employment.

Ninety percent of graduates from previous years are still employed.

The program's curriculum director is Tristan Toleno, a member of the Vermont House of Representatives who is also a partner in Entera Artisanal Catering.

Abilities First here in Springfield is one company taking advantage of the grant to start apprenticeship programs.

They'll use it to provide training for individuals of all abilities.

Apprenticeships have been around for decades, but they are now growing in popularity.

One that Abilities First has already started is in materials handling, where employees work to make tiles, planters and many more products from a recycled paper and concrete mixture.

They're also working on starting other apprenticeship programs with the grant from the Missouri registered apprenticeship grant program.

Ozarks Technical College is helping companies set up apprenticeships.

They say because the unemployment rate is low, employers have a smaller pool of workers to pull from.

So finding those with the specific skills they need is more difficult.

An apprenticeship program can help them train an employee for the company's specific needs.

While working as an apprentice, for usually one-to-five years, the employee is getting paid the whole time, but gradually earns more.

""It really benefits the employer and the employee at the end of the day, because the employer is going to see benefits from increase productivity,"" said Sara Coatney, OTC. ""And the employee really benefits because they're solidifying their learning, they're progressing through the company, they've got that wage and that career pathway.""

There are several companies here in southwest Missouri working on apprenticeship programs with OTC right now, including positronic Industries, Master's plumbing, and Springfield remanufacturing Corporation to name a few."

The world-renowned vocational school and professional training center located in the Hannover region has been preparing students for the workforce for 150 years.

""I firmly believe that to strengthen Illinois' economy we need to attract and retain skilled labor,"" Rauner said.

""In order to do that, we need to invest more in training and invest in our young people. Illinois has the talent and the innovative ideas that if cultivated have the potential to produce great things.""

Nearly half a million Germans enter the workforce through apprenticeship programs each year which many have noted is a major component in the country's success in the manufacturing industry.

Rauner toured the school and learned about several of their models, including the Smart Factory Concept and strategic automotive innovation, which he hopes to incorporate into Illinois' growing programs.

To coincide with the governor's meeting, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti visited one of those programs: YouthBuild McLean County, an apprenticeship effort in Normal, IL that provides 85 young people with training in construction, healthcare and information technology.

""Apprenticeship programs like YouthBuild create a supportive environment for students to succeed in Illinois and become leaders,"" Sanguinetti said.

""It's a great program that gives young people hands on training while they are giving back to their communities.""

For every four people who leave the trades, due to retirement, health or other reasons, only one new person is supplied by apprenticeship programs to enter the trades.

The governor hopes by strengthening our apprenticeship programs we can reduce turnover, improve recruitment and create a pipeline of skilled employees.

Middle skill jobs make up the largest part of Illinois' labor market.

The demand is strong for middle skill jobs and they make up the largest part of Illinois' labor market.

By 2024, 50% of all job openings are expected to be middle-skill jobs.

Community college graduates are a key component of a strong competitive workforce.

""I think there is no substitute for the real world experience and hands on application that apprenticeships provide,"" said President Terry Wilkerson of Rend Lake College.

""This experience reinforces the skill sets provided by the college in the classroom.""

""The relevance of apprenticeships is embodied in the contextualization of the classroom experience in the real world context of working, so what has been the theoretically becomes much more relevant,"" said President Kenneth Ender of Harper College."
517,Jonathan Miller,4/25/2018 14:54,"FRANKFORT, Ky. - Officials from Vermont Thread Gage in Franklin, the Institute for American Apprenticeships, and the Kentucky Labor Cabinet today announced a new Registered Apprenticeship program that will bring Machine Operator jobs to Kentucky over the next several months.

Through an extensive recruitment process, up to 12 individuals will be selected for an eight-week education program at Vermont Thread Gage in Franklin - a manufacturer of threaded ring and plug gages for a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, medical, fastener, and general cutting tools.

Upon completion of the education program, individuals will be chosen to participate in a year-long Registered Apprenticeship program where they will earn full wages and benefits.

""The Kentucky Labor Cabinet is proud to partner with Vermont Thread Gage and the Institute for American Apprenticeships to bring skilled labor to the commonwealth,"" Labor Cabinet Secretary Derrick Ramsey said.

""Registered Apprenticeships provide a proven training model for employers like Vermont Thread Gage to 'grow their own.' At the same time, 12 new machine operators will have the opportunity to begin training in a high-skilled profession that can lead to a great career. Together, this is a winning solution for everyone and is another shining example of what the Kentucky Trained. Kentucky Built. Registered Apprenticeship program is all about.""

The program is designed for unemployed and underemployed Kentucky residents.

Successful completion of the program will lead directly to full-time employment as a machine operator.

According to Monica Greene, president and CEO of Vermont Thread Gage and its parent company Vermont Precision Tools, the program will not only address an immediate shortage for machine operators, but help the company sustain long-term growth needed to meet industry demand.

""By partnering with IAA, VTG expects to graduate dozens of apprentices and rapidly increase the capabilities and skills of the men and women working on our manufacturing floor,"" Greene said.

""This high quality training and apprenticeship program will prepare those seeking advanced manufacturing careers and sustain our growth for many years to come.""

The pay scale for apprenticeship graduates will start at $13.00 per hour.

Apprentices will have the potential to earn $14.00 or more per hour after six months and $15.00 or more per hour upon the completion of a one-year apprenticeship.

Further wage growth potential exists after the apprenticeship based on performance and overall growth within the organization.

Overtime may be available, and the positions will also include a comprehensive benefits package as eligible.

""The Institute for American Apprenticeships is honored to have been asked to partner with Vermont Thread Gage to establish an apprenticeship program for their organization,"" said Steven Lutton, executive director of the Institute for American Apprenticeships.

""We are excited to develop a program specifically for Vermont Thread Gage that attracts and trains motivated individuals with the skills necessary to enter employment ready, able, and motivated to work at an exceptional Kentucky employer such as Vermont Thread Gage."".

State legislators also reacted to today's announcement, praising the company's investment into local workforce.

""The accomplishments of a local manufacturing business, Vermont Thread Gage, have not only been recognized in Franklin but at a regional, national, and worldwide level,"" State Sen. David Givens, R-Greensburg, said.

""I'd like to congratulate Vermont Thread Gage on their impressive history and wish them luck on their new apprenticeship program. Thriving local businesses lead to a promising future within Senate District 9 and across the Commonwealth of Kentucky.""

524,Staff,4/26/2018 10:16,"One of the greatest issues facing today's residential construction industry is a shortage of skilled workers.

We found that many product manufacturers have ideas that will help.

It's no secret that residential construction businesses are hurting for labor.

According to IKO Roofing, reasons include the housing bubble burst in 2007, changing demographics, reduced immigration, a lack of vocational education programs, and the public perception of the trades.

As a result, the number of young workers entering the industry is falling far short of the amount of individuals leaving, and the Baby Boomers who are retiring.

According to USA Today, there were 158,000 job openings in construction in December 2017, up from 140,000 a year earlier.

In late 2017, 84 percent of contractors surveyed by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo cited the availability of workers and cost as their most significant problems.

""As contractors face issues involving staffing on jobsites, many of those trade people have felt a heightened pressure to work more efficiently,"" observes Klein.

""At the same time, electricians have noted that the jobs' physical demands, and even the lack of training, has driven more experienced professionals away from the industry.""

Increasingly, building product manufacturers are developing products and systems that help make workersites more efficient.

Home Innovation Research Labs has proposed a few ideas on how manufacturers can help the industry-including developing products that speed up installation without impacting quality or reliability, introducing products and systems that can be installed by one person, and shifting more of installation processes to the factory rather than in the field.

Beyond product development, the manufacturing industry might seem like an unlikely place to look for a reprieve from the construction labor struggle.

Many of these brands across all product categories have been facing similar labor shortages.

A recent study by Deloitte Consulting LLP and The Manufacturing Institute found that a predicted two million manufacturing jobs will go unfilled between 2015 and 2025 due to a lack of workers with necessary skills.

This is forcing manufacturers to look for, and find, solutions.

For residential construction businesses both big and small, there are all sorts of creative solutions for alleviating staffing issues.

Here are five strategies taken from success stories in the manufacturing world.

Partnering with a local training initiative or technical college can boost programs that may lack necessary resources and create a pipeline of trained workers already familiar with your brand.

Through its recent Pliers Promise, Lincolnshire Ill.-based Klein Tools is donating more than $10,000 in Klein product to Project H.O.O.D., a Chicago non-profit organization that brings employment resources, skills, and tools into underserved communities on the city's south side.

Through the partnership, Klein will equip 15 students in the organization's construction training program.

Klein will also offer the program's top graduates scholarships to Chicago's HVAC Technical Institute for training in either electrical or HVAC trades.

Faucet and hardware manufacturer Watermark Designs has taken advantages of local labor resources in and around Brooklyn, N.Y., its home community of more than 30 years.

The company works with several New York organizations to get the word out about job openings, including NYC Business Solutions Industrial & Transportation and New York's Department of Labor and Economic Development Corporation.

""As a smaller, local manufacturing company with deep roots in Brooklyn and a love of our city, we have long believed in giving back as much as possible,"" says Avi Abel, president and owner of Watermark Designs.

Apprenticeships and internships have many benefits: companies train prospective employees before hiring them full-time, and students gain hands-on job experience while earning an income, offsetting some of the costs of technical instruction.

Uponor North America recently rolled out an apprenticeship program with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry to help recruit, train, and retain skilled workers.

The three-year program is focused in the company's maintenance department, an area where Uponor is particularly struggling to find qualified candidates.

""In all skilled occupations across Minnesota, employers are seeking solutions to train new and existing workers for today's more technical jobs,"" says Ken Peterson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry.

Headquartered in Louisville, Ky., GE Appliances takes on 50 students age 18-21 each summer for the Louisville mayor's SummerWorks program.

Students work as full-time GE employees for the duration of their summer break, learning the ins-and outs of manufacturing work.

There are many organizations, both local and national, that provide resources, application assistance, and training to individuals looking for jobs.

Project H.O.O.D., mentioned above, is just one example of an organization training a group of individuals that might not traditionally be recruited by construction companies.

Watermark Designs has also partnered with the Center for Employment Opportunities, a non-profit organization that pairs formerly incarcerated individuals with job openings.

CEO recommends candidates to Watermark based on the company's needs, after which the company can interview, hire, and train the candidates.

Many students, especially at the high school level, are encouraged to apply to and attend four-year universities, and are often unaware of the possibilities of careers in the trades.

By working with local schools to organize presentations, field trips, summer programs, or classes, businesses can give young students familiarity with a career path they might otherwise not have considered.

GE Appliances works with Junior Achievement of Kentuckiana, an organization providing career and finance information for elementary, middle, and high school students.

GE hosts high school student experience tours at the GE headquarters and participates in Junior Achievement career fair events, where students are exposed to the elements of manufacturing and careers at GE. GE has also opened a storefront in Junior Achievement's Finance Park, which simulates hands-on finance and job experiences for middle and high school students.

525,Staff,4/26/2018 10:54,"Fifteen Allegan County students in a program that pairs a second chance to complete a high school education while arming them with skilled labor credentials, celebrated completion on Wednesday, April 18, at Allegan Public Schools administration building.

The Integrated Education and Technology program of Allegan County consists of GED or high school completion alongside accelerated technical training, so in a short period of time, adult learners are able to complete their diploma or GED and obtain an industry-recognized skill in construction, manufacturing or nursing.

""It continues to take a village to get students to graduate but it's not enough,"" said Laura Feffer, Allegan Alternative High School principal.

""They need training to get a job, keep a job, and break the cycle of poverty.""

""The business community desperately needs to hire skilled trades and higher skills means higher wages.""

It's also a success story for the collaboration of community agencies and adult education providers who have been meeting for three years to pool their resources to teach students not only the academic content to complete high school but also the employability skills to earn a sustainable wage.

""We were operating in little silos and now the silo walls are coming down,"" said Brenda Nyhoff, director of Allegan Adult Education.

Plainwell Renaissance High School principal Tammy Glupker said while sister programs who care about Allegan learners were operating within their own walls, no one really knew what the other was doing.

She said three years ago, Nyhoff invited them all together to break down those walls.

""We did a great job in those silos for 10 years getting people to graduation, but to do better, students needed to know where to go once they graduated, what's out there, and to give them some ideas of what they can do for the next years in life,"" Glupker said.

Nyhoff said for some, it's the first time in their family anyone has earned anything higher than a diploma.

""These organizations have been meeting to communicate between those offering education and those offering jobs to create a pathway to a softer entry,"" she said.

Construction-Pre-Apprentice Certificate Training is taught by Michigan Career and Technical Institute in Plainwell and is not only a State of Michigan post secondary credential but nationally portable, being accepted by the Department of Labor, said Brian Smith, MCTI instructor.

The training is 75 percent hands on, building then deconstructing five scaled down homes.

The other 25 percent concerns Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines.

Brandon Howland, of Wayland, said the training taught him the basics he needed to get an entry-level construction position and the possibility of further training for a more specific trade such as electrician.

He already had an interview set up with a truss and lumber company.

Tucker, a mom and dishwasher, will be graduating with a high school diploma on May 29.

She said the program also paid for transportation to and from MCTI. Tuition is paid through grants by Michigan Works! and other partners.

The training covers the content that companies are seeking for employees through workforce development.

Certified Production Technician Training program is nationally recognized through the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council for safety, quality, processes and maintenance.

Auburn Hand of Otsego said to get an idea of what jobs manufacturers had to offer, they toured Parker Hannifin, Trans-Matic, Ropes Courses, Bay Valley and MEC, to name a few.

Ryan Jones of Kalamazoo said the hardest part of the training was getting there two days a week for 10 to 12 weeks.

""It'll look good on my resume instead of walking into an interview with nothing to offer but hard work,"" he said.

""It was a great experience with fun instructors.""

""I just want to get better and improve with professional development.""

Certified Nursing Assistant Training is a seven-week course with another week of clinical training in the field.

On Wednesday three students received their pins as Certified Nursing Aides.

Once passing state testing the certification is for Certified Nursing Assistant.

Amber Caswell and two young men were in the CNA program this year.

Jack Hitts III of Hopkins had already been hired by The Laurels of Hudsonville.

Jonathan Keur of Allegan was late to the ceremony because he had an interview at Allegan General Hospital.

Caswell is a dietary aide at Allegan Medical Care Community.

Sue Fleming a MiWorks instructor for work place excellence said while its important for the community to work together as a team for employability skills, the credit goes to the students.

""They balanced a lot-school, family, training, jobs-it's a lot more than most adults can juggle,"" she said.

The Integrated Education and Training program's first group of students started last year with 14 students and completed in May 2017.

GRCC was new to the mix this year and this summer, the IET program will be adding a Going Pro Apprenticeship Readiness program.

The readiness program offers a paid work experience over the summer with a local manufacturing company.

Which results in course credits and certificates at no cost.

It is also a pathway to a registered apprenticeship and nationally recognized credential."
528,Cathy Koziowicz,4/26/2018 15:45,"Nearly 30 Monona Grove High School juniors and seniors are gaining practical hands-on paid job training while completing related academic classes at Monona Grove High School.  In the past, students have graduated high school and attended college with no idea of what they wanted to study. Or students can be nearly done with college and realize they did not need to attend college to get their ideal job.

Being involved in the Youth Apprenticeship (YA) program in high school can curb these problems.  ?Students are doing career searching their sophomore year so they are ready for this program their junior and senior years,? said Josh Fassl, director of the Dane County School Consortium that coordinates the YA program for Dane County."

""At the same time, it allows the district to build a sustainable workforce of highly needed, trained employees. It's truly a win-win and it only makes sense for us to expand this mutually beneficial partnership. We are thankful to our partner organizations across the city for making this program so successful.""

Next year, the district will triple the program, adding 18 apprentices for a total of 24.

The program will also likely expand to include specialties in HVAC and steamfitting, in addition to the current specialties of electrical and plumbing.

Apprentices who complete the program become certified mechanics of their trade and are guaranteed full-time employment with the school district, the district said.

""Initiatives like the Maintenance Apprenticeship Program are one of many ways that the School District sets up our city for long-term success,"" Kenney said.

""This particular program offers a career pipeline for skilled trade workers to develop right here in Philadelphia, preparing them for meaningful careers and ensuring we have a sustainable and talented workforce for the future. While we invest in early literacy and added student supports, we also must ensure that there are exciting opportunities for students when they graduate.""

To be considered for the program, candidates must have at least six CTE credits or equivalent work experience, meet all application criteria and complete oral examinations, according to the school district.

Those selected for the program are required to complete 8,000 hours of on-the-job training and 576 hours of classroom instruction."
537,Don Sergent,4/29/2018 0:00,"When Franklin?s Vermont Thread Gage announced last week a plan to fill its need for machine operators through an apprenticeship program, it may have seemed like a departure from the normal workforce development model.  Hoping to fill up to 12 positions, the manufacturer of threaded ring and plug gages for automotive and other sectors turned not to postsecondary education but to an age-old model for growing workers in-house.  ?This training model is becoming increasingly popular,? said Jarrad Hensley, director of communications for the Kentucky Labor Cabinet that administers the Registered Apprenticeship program being used by Vermont Thread Gage. ?Companies are saying they?d rather have an apprentice than a four-year college graduate coming in with no work experience.?

The Franklin company is using the Institute for American Apprenticeships, also based in Vermont, to provide an eight-week education program. After completing that program, the dozen or so trainees will begin a yearlong apprenticeship after which their pay can potentially be bumped up from $13 to $15 per hour.  In a news release, Kentucky Labor Cabinet Secretary Derrick Ramsey said such apprenticeships are a way for companies to ?grow their own? workers.  ?Together, this is a winning solution for everyone,? Ramsey said."
539,Staff,4/30/2018 0:00,"Having a well-trained, adaptable workforce is critical to the nation's economic growth and well-being.

So it is welcome news that the federal Department of Labor and other Washington agencies are taking a hard new look at the nation's frequently criticized job training programs.

One place they ought to look is South Carolina, which has conducted an exemplary set of job training programs for nearly six decades and has a wealth of experience in what works.

As the Congressional Budget Office pointed out in its recent 10-year economic forecast, slow growth in the nation's workforce in coming years will limit the ability of the nation to afford its safety net of social programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as its national defense establishment and other federal programs, without higher taxes.

Tax increases will limit economic growth still further.

One way to overcome this limit is to improve the skills of the nation's workforce and draw more bystanders back into employment.

The administration in Washington has proposed tying welfare programs more closely to a requirement that the recipient actively seek employment or attend a job training course.

A March 30 report by the inspector general of the Labor Department found that one of the most prominent entry-level job training programs offered by the department, Job Corps, was falling far short of its objectives.

Job Corps, for example, advertises that it will prepare trainees for employment in specific industries where they can earn up to $50,000 a year instead of a minimum wage.

The Labor Department IG found, by reviewing the five-year employment history of a sample of Job Corps trainees who graduated in 2010-11, that the average annual wage they earned was just over $12,000.

The current minimum wage of $7.50 an hour would have produced an income of $15,000.

Disappointingly, it found that only about 40 percent of the graduates found the employment they were trained for.

Many returned to minimum-wage jobs they held before undertaking Job Corps training, no better off than when they began the process.

By contrast, the South Carolina Technical College System, which educates more people per year than the entire Job Corps, reports that it placed 87 percent either in a job related to their education or further employment-related studies.

The Labor Department IG found that Job Corps relies on contractors to place graduates, but that most graduates who found employment did it on their own.

Contractors failed to keep adequate tracking data for the graduates they processed, leaving a disconnect between Job Corps and employers in the occupations for which it offers training.

In South Carolina, by contrast, a branch of the state technical education system called ReadySC goes to employers and finds out exactly what skills they need, then trains workers for those specific skills.

It's a simpler, more effective method than the federal system, and it produces results.

The federal Department of Labor is reported to be interested in promoting apprenticeships as another way to train beginning workers.

South Carolina's Technical College System already has had a program called Apprenticeship South Carolina for more than a decade.

It started modestly in 2007 with 90 companies and 777 apprentices.

It now has 918 companies and 14,475 active apprentices, according to the agency.

A growing criticism of the nation's higher education system is that while employers look for a bachelor's degree for entry-level employees because it is a test of maturity, most colleges are not turning out the kind of workers employers need.

In South Carolina 57 percent of the students in higher education attend one of the state's six technical colleges.

The classic path to a bachelor's degree and higher is there at state colleges and universities for those who want and need it, but the state offers an alternative path of excellent, up-to-date technical training for those who prefer that path.

It is a sensible approach to preparing tomorrow's labor force that offers valuable lessons for federal agencies."
542,Joe Hendrix,4/30/2018 12:00,"As the Kamtek Training Area Leader, I see firsthand how beneficial the Apprenticeship Alabama program is both to our company and to the employees who use the skills they learn throughout their careers. Our manufacturing company utilizes the Apprenticeship Alabama program via the AlabamaWorks initiative.  We have two registered apprenticeship programs: Tool and Die and Multi-Craft Maintenance. Currently, we have 40 apprentices between the two programs. The apprentices learn skills from the partner community college and other people in the field to gain insight into why a job is done a particular way. This was the reason tool and die apprentice Austin Smith decided to apply for the apprenticeship. The nearly five-month apprentice learns from Jouneyman tool makers and assists overhead crane operators in their job responsibilities.

Maintenance apprentice Alan Thornton heard about the apprenticeship program as an employee through an internal job posting. He considered the apprenticeship to be a good career opportunity. Thornton enjoys working with robots and doing electrical work, which are part of the program.  It is good business for Kamtek to work with colleges to provide a portion of their training. We are able to work more closely with colleges and their technical programs to keep them informed of our needs and changes that are occurring in our industry."
543,Staff,4/30/2018 12:38,"Have you ever met someone who went to school, acquired loads of book knowledge, but then had trouble performing in the real world?

Beth Ann Wright, Founder of opusomni , a company that seeks to translate book knowledge into ""Real life practical experience"" has seen just that many times.

That is exactly why opusomni's unique apprenticeships and educational programs have caught the eye of the U.S. government as a innovative way to re-tool education and boost the economy.

There's a problem: many good jobs remain vacant in today's economy.

About 30 million U.S. jobs pay an average of $55,000 per year and don't require bachelor's degree , yet many of these jobs are getting bypassed as young people opt for the college route without a clear career path in mind.

The Trump administration has consistently championed apprenticeships as a means to develop and enrich our nation's workforce.

Last summer, President Trump issued an executive order that expanded and promoted apprenticeships as ""Affordable pathways to secure, high-paying jobs."" Around the same time, he accepted Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's seemingly pie-in-the-sky challenge of developing an apprenticeship program that could create 5 million jobs.

Wright's opusomni is part of the solution, as it connects the dots between the U.S. Department of Labor and employers to expand the DOL's Registered Apprenticeships program , offering a ""Turnkey,"" free-market solution to scale this program across their companies and help workers train for lucrative jobs without even setting foot on a university campus.

Employers partner with opusomni and the DOL through an Employee Participation Agreement, and the DOL then covers the cost of the opusomni ecosystem's Registered Apprenticeship services.

Employers also may receive other state and local tax credits, further incentivizing their participation.

Registered Apprentices earn $15 per hour and are eligible for a raise every quarter until they finish their program-not bad, considering the alternative is thousands of dollars in college debt.

""From day one, they start earning and learning,"" Wright explained to Red Alert Politics.

As a Registered Sponsor of the program, opusomni serves as the ""Intermediary Partner,"" providing companies their Purple Forest app for apprentices to guide their on-the-job training and competency-based skills education.

According to Wright, the app ""Curates the world's best online, on-demand educational content"" and ""Tailors the most relevant educational content"" to each user.

Wright believes users will find the Purple Forest app incredibly intuitive.

""The system is so smart that learners don't even need to know what they need to learn to get started,"" Wright said.

""They just fire up the Purple Forest App, click on 'Set' and start scrolling through the list as the system asks them, 'What competency skill would you like to work on?' The learners simply scroll through the list and quickly get an idea of what they need to learn.""

Wright noted that the system ""Snaps together personal, relevant, specific competency-based goals"" based on ""Five factors known to drive human performance achievement.""

The opusomni platform could also be the ideal solution for employers looking to upskill and reskill their workers.

More than one in four adults surveyed by the Europe-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported a mismatch between their current skills and the qualifications demanded by their jobs.

The World Economic Forum also estimates that approximately 35 percent of the skills demanded for jobs across industries will change by 2020.

By providing on-the-job, real world training, the Purple Forest app would eliminate the need to go ""Back to school"" and allow current employees to become greater assets to their companies.

Opusomni's first Registered Apprenticeship program, launching in May, will be geared towards entrepreneurs.

Pending DOL approval, opusomni will expand their ""Ecosystem"" to include clinical and translational research scientists, clinical research professionals and teachers, and eventually expand to IT, technical, and construction professions.

Millennials have suffered under the burden of overwhelming student debt, graduating with an average of $37,000 in student loans.

More shocking is that at a quarter of college graduates are overqualified for their jobs according to the Urban Institute.

Other organizations estimate that the number is as high as 48 percent.

Apprenticeship programs, encouraged through innovative partnerships like this one, can help put an end to millennial misery by providing a launch pad for more lucrative careers."

557,Mike Valente,5/2/2018 18:34,"Ten women are among the first to graduate from Bridgeport's Step Up for Women Advanced Manufacturing Pre-Apprenticeship Program, as they look ahead to a career in manufacturing.

The 10-week program is a collaboration between West Virginia Women Work and Apprenticeship Works.

It was held at the Robert C. Byrd Institute.

""It is the first one in the country to be developed for women for advanced manufacturing,"" said Lucinda Curry, the director of workforce development at Apprenticeship Works.

The program, which is tuition-free, helps women prepare for entry-level manufacturing jobs and teaches them the skills they need to work in the industry.

""This program is very important, especially in this area, for women to get there into non-traditional fields, because there isn't a big market for it,"" said Lakiesha Hines, program coordinator for West Virginia Women Work.

""There isn't a lot of schooling for it, so we are trying to set the bar and get these ladies out there to get higher paying jobs.""

Women only comprise 29 percent of the manufacturing industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Speaking to 5 News Wednesday, the newly-minted graduates said programs like these prove there is a place for women in the industry.

""Most of the time you're taking jobs that guys don't want,"" said Martha Anderson.

""We're tired of that. We want to work in a job where there are guys around. We don't care, so long as we're treated with respect and they learn that we know what we're doing.""

Curry said that women are in the perfect position to help close the skills gap facing manufacturers across the state.

""[Employers] are often very pleasantly surprised,"" said Curry.

""A lot of times, women have more dexterity than men. Oftentimes, they have more patience and do better precision work. It dispels a lot of those myths that a woman couldn't do the job, because they certainly can do the job, and oftentimes they do a superior job.""

The Step Up program expanded to RCBI Bridgeport, after West Virginia Women Work received a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor in 2017."
558,Jonathan Weaver,5/2/2018 19:07,"BRIDGEPORT - Not only did Sara Hamner learn new skills during the Step Up for Women Advanced Manufacturing Pre-Apprenticeship program in Bridgeport the past few months, but she also achieved a new career.

The Buckhannon resident, who first became interested in the class at Robert C. Byrd Institute after seeing a newspaper advertisement, began working April 30 as a sandblaster at HQ Aero Management in Bridgeport.

""This is different than anything I've ever done,"" Hamner said.

""I thought I would take the class because sometimes women in this area have a lower pay, especially if they are in administrative work. I knew I was ready for something different.""

""This has been a good confidence builder.""

Hamner has other family members who work in the manufacturing field, and said they were encouraging as she went through the 10-week program and graduated with her manufacturing operator certificate Wednesday.

Step Up program coordinator Lakiesha Hines was also looking for a career change and said she is proud of the 10 women who graduated.

Of Fairmont, Hines graduated from the West Virginia Women Work construction program in Morgantown in 2017 before applying to oversee the first women's manufacturing class in Bridgeport.

The Bridgeport institute's first graduating class includes four students who have already received jobs, Hines said.

Those graduates manufacture mining equipment, are in the aerospace industry or are in the surveying field.

""We're pushing non-traditional careers here,"" Hines said.

""The percentages of women in this workforce is still very low, only about 29 percent, but that's why we're here - to try and bring up the numbers on that and let them know that women are capable of doing these jobs.""

Other than tours of a pair of manufacturing companies in Marion County or guest speakers from other manufacturing companies, all hands-on instruction was done at the institute in Bridgeport through institute machinist Sonny Bunnell.

Students attended classes from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays and also were taught personal finance, resume-writing and other life skills.

Martha Anderson, of Farmington, heard about the class through a friend.

The former housekeeper, restaurant employee and parent is also confident she will work in a new field soon.

""I wanted to better myself,"" Anderson said.

""I had fun through it all. It's been so informative and fun learning stuff that I've never before.""

Erson is also encouraging her daughter, Kelsey, to enroll.

Participants received free tuition and travel reimbursements as well as industrial work clothes and boots.

Misty Nicholas, who was a student five years ago, has coordinated eight construction programs at a training center in Morgantown during the past four years.

Students from the Morgantown location have either successfully gained employment or opened their own businesses after learning carpentry, electrical wiring, nutrition training or plumbing.

""She was a great example of what I want to be and what I strive for to help these ladies with,"" Hines said of Nicholas.

About 120 women per year graduate from the five manufacturing or construction program sites, with a Wheeling site yet to have its first class, West Virginia Women Work Executive Director Kristina Szczyrbak said.

Hines' fellow 2017 graduate is the program coordinator.

Hines will continue to help the recent graduates try to secure employment.

The Bridgeport Step Up program is accepting applications for the next 11-week class, set to begin July 9.

A maximum of 15 students can enroll in the Bridgeport class due to available machinery.

All students must have either graduated high school or passed equivalency exams.

The Step Up program expanded to Robert C. Byrd Institute in Bridgeport with support from a Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grant.

A similar event took place in Lisbon last week.

Jessica Borza, the MVMC executive director, explained the fair is a response to a change in the local manufacturing industry.  ?We?ve been working on building up apprenticeships in our area again,? she said. ?What we were seeing is there?s more of a willingness to hire people and train them on the job.?  Local manufacturers are looking to fill more than 50 paid apprenticeships for machinist, welding/fitting and industrial maintenance positions. "
571,Rebecca Lurye,5/4/2018 6:00,"Less then a year ago, Olivia Hernandez decided to transfer out of the high school where she'd missed months of class to suspensions for fighting and bad behavior.

She cried, for the lost credits that meant she likely wouldn't graduate on time, and for what she expected to find at East Hartford's Synergy Alternative High School - students who didn't work and teachers who didn't care.

Instead, the East Hartford native found support, direction and an unexpected step up in a growing field: advanced manufacturing.

Hernandez, 18, is graduating this month with a pre-apprenticeship at AdChem Manufacturing Technologies Inc., a Manchester company that builds parts for aerospace company Pratt & Whitney.

""This is what I want my career to be now,"" she said at ACMT on Tuesday, her regular shift at the 48,000-square-foot manufacturing facility.

""Synergy gave me everything I need.""

She landed the part-time job in January through a new program that takes students through a 72-hour, online curriculum, called Tooling-U. Run by the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology in East Hartford, it's one of two new programs this year registered with the state Office of Apprenticeship, which credentials workers once they complete paid training programs.

In Waterbury, the Manufacturing Alliance Service Corp. is running its version with 12 students from three city high schools: Wilby, Kennedy and Crosby.

In East Hartford six of the 14 students taking Tooling-U have already been hired part-time, lending a hands-on component to their education.

The pre-apprenticeship programs are a boon to local manufacturers, which rely on an array of workforce pipeline programs to fill open positions.

Economists estimate there are thousands of open manufacturing positions across the state.

The pre-apprenticeships have an even bigger impact on the students at Synergy Alternative High School, which serves students who are struggling in traditional academic environments.

Like Hernandez, 19-year-old Faviela Delgado chose to attend Synergy this year in the hopes of graduating on time.

The young mother had moved from Windsor to East Hartford as a junior and disliked her new school so much that she stopped going - missing the last two months of the year.

Now, Delgado is also graduating with an AMCT pre-apprenticeship - a weekly gig she expects to turn into full-time work.

""Not a lot of people have this experience. They try hard to get a job like this, so coming out of high school with it, it's good.""

On a recent Tuesday at ACMT, Hernandez and Delgado watched a production associate demonstrate some new technology, a fully-automated robot the size of a small room that can grip pieces of metal and bend them six different ways to make complex brackets.

Synergy Alternative High School students Faviela Delgado, 19 and Olivia Hernandez, 18 are introduced to a robotic bending cell at Advanced Composites Metalforming Technologies Inc. in Manchester by production associate Joel Maldonado-Ortiz.

""That's a big money machine,"" Hernandez said after the hands-on demonstration.

She and Delgado were impressed, but they don't typically enjoy working with automated robots - or as Delgado puts it, baby-sitting machines.

Delgado thinks she's heavy-handed, so she lets Hernandez take the lead on the more delicate steps, like making sure pieces are perfectly aligned.

In their short time at ACMT, they've noticed that other women seem to gravitate toward composites, too, like the female employee who greeted them warmly on their first day.

""She said, 'It's good you came. You don't see a lot of ladies who want to do it,'"" Delgado recalled.

Women are underrepresented in the field, holding just 27 percent of the country's 7.6 million manufacturing jobs in production work, transportation and material moving, according to 2016 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Women have held about a third of all United States manufacturing jobs for the last 45 years.

Lynn Raicik, CCAT's education and workforce development associate director, said she's glad to see female students finding their niche in the field.

She recently reminded Hernandez and Delgado that they're excelling at the online Tooling-U with near 100 percent accuracy on the program's tests.

In the summer and fall, another 26 students will begin the program at Synergy and work toward pre-apprenticeships of their own, according to Dan Rios of Capital Workforce Partners, which serves as a liaison between the school district and manufacturers.

Principal Craig Outhouse is applying for grants to try to keep the program rolling after that.

He hopes after a few successful cohorts, employers will see the value in hiring students - even if the state Department of Labor isn't subsidizing their wages, like it did this spring.

Two other grants totaling about $100,000 paid for the manufacturing curriculum, resume skills training and Rios, the support staff at Synergy.

""If we find a way to connect kids in high school to the world of work, there's a chance we can get them to turn around their academic performance, and in time to graduate,"" he said.

""I hope this is a start. I would love it if three to five years from now, all of our students had one foot in both worlds.""

572,Mai Hoangmaihoang@yakimaherald.com,5/4/2018 18:41,"A year ago, three West Valley High School students signed commitment letters with three Yakima Valley companies, the first step toward a new youth apprenticeship through the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee, or AJAC. The organization coordinates apprenticeships to supply skilled aerospace and advanced manufacturing workers for companies throughout Washington state.

With the average age of participants at 33, AJAC established the youth apprenticeship program to help high school students gain job experience and credentials, including a journey-level card and college credits, before they graduate.

The three students, now seniors - Osborne Rogers, Brad Ethier and Trevor Mackey - were part of the first group of apprentices, along with students from Tacoma Public Schools.

By the end of the apprenticeship - which is expected to be finished in the next several months - the students will have completed 2,000 hours of job experience altogether and received 150 hours of additional instruction.

Ethier, 18, has completed more than 500 hours at Pexco Aerospace in Union Gap, a plastics extrusion plant that makes parts for the interior of several Boeing aircraft.

He plans to continue pursuing a career as a machinist after his high school graduation.

If one person doesn't need anything, I'll see if anyone else needs help.

What's one thing that surprised you about your apprenticeship?

What surprised me was how much I learned and how much I retained.

Usually in school, when I'm not interested in the subject, it's hard to learn and to retain the information.

I've retained a lot of what I learned at this apprenticeship and think a lot about it.

Even when I'm not at work, I'm always thinking about my work and how I should have done a job a certain way and how I will do it next time.

How has your apprenticeship influenced your future plans?

Initially, I thought about a job in the automotive or construction fields.

The one thing that got to me was the elements - these jobs require being outside in the hot weather or the cold weather.

Now that I worked at this apprenticeship, I know what the conditions are like.

Over time, I realized it just takes time to learn some of the concepts.

Mackey, 18, has worked about 800 hours for CubCrafters, which manufactures general aviation aircraft in Yakima.

I either have something from the day before or I pick up a job from the FIFO - it stands for first in, first out - which is a list of jobs that need to be done.

If I need help, I'll ask my co-worker Mark for help; he's really experienced.

The jobs include ones in fabrication - grinding, smashing, bending.

On Tuesdays, a buyer of a plane comes in and you take them through making parts for the plane.

It would have been way harder at the beginning of the apprenticeship to do that same job.

Now I know I can get through it after completing other jobs that took a long time.

It seemed like I could only keep my attention on a job for so long.

Now, I have a different attitude toward doing those longer jobs.

How has this apprenticeship shaped your future career plans?

On my third week, I didn't ask for help on a job and it took me all day.

About a month ago I did the same job and I said ""Oh my gosh, this is super hard."" My co-worker said, ""What are you worried about?"" It took me a half-hour because I asked him for help.

Rogers, 18, has worked about 800 hours at Triumph Actuation Systems' machine shop.

Rogers hopes to continue at Triumph and eventually get a job with a manufacturer in Western Washington.

I have a trainer who is able to give me advice if I don't know how to do something.

What lessons have you learned during your apprenticeship?

There are times where there is a task I do at Triumph and halfway through I realize I don't know what the next step is, so I'll have to go and ask my trainer.

Almost everything I know how to do there, he's shown me how to do it or helped me through it so I could figure it out on my own.

I didn't expect how nice the employees were going to be.

I thought, it's a machine shop with older guys who wouldn't want younger guys because they're going to steal their jobs.

How did the apprenticeship compare with your expectations?

The first day I came, they assigned me a deburr trainer who walked me through the task.

It's cool to know that I'm making parts for an airplane."

Another option high school graduates have is checking out where local apprenticeship programs are located and learning a trade.

In a new program at Herrin High School, juniors and seniors are able to finish a bulk of apprenticeship classes before graduating.

Whether it is construction, pipefitting, heating and cooling, or plumbing, options exist outside of a four-year college, according to Griffin Goetz, assistant administrator for the Illinois Laborers' and Contractors Joint Apprenticeship and Training Fund.

""The time of getting a four-year college degree and coming to Southern Illinois and thinking you are get a job paying $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year, that is a dream,"" he said.

""It is not reality. Kids are forced to go to college, last a year, don't get a degree and are still stuck with thousands of dollars in debt.""

The laborer's program has a training base set up in Marion.

The program takes applications for its apprenticeship program on the first Tuesday of the month.

Applicants must have a valid driver's license, graduate high school or have a GED, and pass a drug test.

Goetz said if the score is high enough on the test, students are brought in for an interview with somebody from the apprenticeship program, the local union and a contractor representative.

If they score high enough, they will be placed on the eligibility list and later be called to start classes.

Once the apprenticeship starts, the employees will complete 600 hours of classroom instruction and 3,000 hours of on-the-job training over three years.

Employees start out at 75 percent of what a journeyman gets paid the first year.

It jumps to 85 percent the second year and 95 percent the third year.

A journeyman usually makes about $28.23 an hour, Goetz said.

""These men and woman graduate from the program with zero college debt,"" he said.

The Plumbing and Pipefitters Local 160 Union also has an apprenticeship program with a similar setup, according to Doug Pursell, training coordinator with Local 160.

The applicant must be 18, have a high school diploma or GED, official transcripts, and will also take an aptitude test.

Qualified individuals are interviewed based on scores and placed on a working roster to start the classroom portion.

The pipefitter's apprenticeship is a five-year program where students go to class two nights a week year-round for three hours a night.

The students aren't paid to be in school, but they are usually working during the day and earning a wage.

Classes are free to the apprentice, and they are paid based on the number of hours completed in the classroom and on the job.

Pursell said the average wage for a journeyman is $44 an hour.

Apprentices are started at 40 percent of that wage, and move up each year.

Goetz said the Illinois Laborers are working with Herrin High School on a new program that will allow juniors and seniors the opportunity to finish a large chunk of apprenticeship classes before finishing high school.

In a new program approved by the Herrin School Board a couple weeks ago dubbed The High School Craft Preparation Program, Goetz said juniors are brought into the apprenticeship program, taught how to pour concrete, rake asphalt, work on a bridge and obtain the instruction through the classwork.

He said by the time the students finish the program as seniors, they will have 12 of the program's 15 classes needed for the apprenticeship program.

""We have seen a need for years that with the budget cuts, some of the first things that get cut are the trade classes - wood shop, metal shops,"" Goetz said.

The Laborers are also hoping to partner with Shawnee Community College to grant those who complete the apprenticeship program 27 hours toward an associate's degree.

Goetz said this program is still pending with the Illinois Community College Board.

The apprenticeship program is working with SCC to allow the high school students in the preparation program dual credit to the community college.

""Our program isn't just a decision of should I go to college, should I not go to college,"" he said.

Jason Stutes, HVAC instructor at John A. Logan College, says he has seen a tremendous growth in HVAC jobs available.

Recently, those jobs have been in maintenance positions because of the wide-reaching skills of a person with a HVAC background.

He said the class is graduating more than 20 students this year and they have all had jobs before the class finished.

""I see people with higher level degree that either can't get a job or aren't satisfied with their career to come back and try to make money this way,"" Stutes said.

Many times, Stutes said students start the program with intentions to transfer to a four-year school after finishing the program but choose to head straight into the workforce because they figure out how much money they can make.

He said program organizers considered at one point putting a cap on the number of students enrolled in the program but there were concerns about the number of jobs, but that mindset has changed.

""Enrollment has increased and there aren't enough students to fill the amount of jobs out there,"" Stutes said."
576,Hadley Barndollar,5/5/2018 14:43,"KITTERY, Maine A workforce nearing 6,000, more than 200 years in the making, may be at risk of flatlining if stakeholders can't find a way to cultivate a regional culture that is supportive of the trades.

The Seacoast Shipyard Association seeks to increase understanding and local partnerships to keep the educational feeder tubes, that send workers to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, well-oiled.

Over the course of Fiscal Year 2018, it's been estimated the shipyard will look to hire approximately 800 more employees, 400 of which would replace roughly 350 retiring workers.

The shipyard has two apprenticeship programs: the four-year Trades Apprenticeship program administered jointly by Great Bay Community College and York County Community College, and the Worker Skills Progression program, a five-year program.

SSA chairman John Joyal said while those programs see strong numbers, interest in the trades needs to be fostered earlier, among high schools, parents and guidance counselors, for example.

""This is one of the things I hope we can do as an association to collectively address the feeder tubes that go into the shipyard,"" said Joyal, who retired after 40 years as a shipyard worker in 2017.

On Tuesday, SSA members traveled to York County Community College's tech center in Sanford, where a precision machining technology program began in 2013.

They met with instructors, students and representatives from the college to collectively discuss workforce development.

Lee Kassler, chairman of the PMT program, said 25,000 to 35,000 employees are needed in the United States to operate CNC equipment.

On average, the country is graduating less than 400 students each year qualified for those jobs, he said.

""Our students get a tremendous education here, they are well sought-after,"" Kassler said, noting Pratt and Whitney, General Dynamics and the shipyard recruit many of their graduates, 85 percent of which have secured jobs by the time they graduate.

""These students, in five simple classes, can start at $18 to $24 an hour. And with a two-year associate degree, make between $24 and $34 an hour. There is tremendous opportunity in this field.""

In 2017, according to SSA's most recent economic report, the shipyard paid $299,519,915 in wages to more than 3,800 civilian employees in Maine from more than 60 communities, with the Sanford/Springvale area topping the list with the most workers at 460, respectively.

The school is set to open in the fall, with the technical center serving eight school districts and 22 communities.

""There is certainly a workforce development need in southern Maine and were part of that equation there,"" said Sanford schools Superintendent David Theoharides.

""I think what weve seen in the last 10 years, it doesnt have to be push, push, push for college. It means getting students career ready. My motivation is lets keep the workforce development going.""

Theoharides said he wants to get students out in the field sooner, taking classes that match their interests and identify skills at a younger age.

The school district is exploring the possibility of a pre-vocational program at the middle school level, he said.

Diane Canada, director of Portsmouth Career Technical Education at Portsmouth High School, said her program has a long-standing relationship with the shipyard.

Students in the welding program finish with industry certifications from the American Welding Society, and each year, four or five apply for the shipyard's apprenticeship programs.

""We have a real challenge in the Portsmouth area with regards to students and their parents being interested in them pursuing the trades,"" Canada said.

""The vast majority of our students identify they want to go to four-year college.That is the crux of my job, to figure that out.""

Last year, Canada said she had to close PCTE's construction trades program because of limited student enrollment.

""I cant say enough how much I hope our students and their parents will be open to the variety of careers that are available for them here in our state,"" she said.

""Take a look at the world of trades today as opposed to the world of trades many of us grew up looking at. It's changed so much. That mindset, 'I dont want my child to work in a CNC factory,' because we have images of old shoe factories in our mind.""

Canada noted how lucrative many trades jobs can be and most workers don't bear the burden of crippling student debt.

In 2017 alone, according to shipyard Public Affairs Specialist Libby Morin, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard reached more than 18,000 students and potential future employees through its workforce development efforts.

""Portsmouth Naval Shipyard consistently works to strengthen our community relationships in the development of our future workforce,"" Morin said.

""Over the years our STEM mentors have interacted with thousands of students at dozens of K-12 schools and universities, children's museums, public libraries and various youth organizations in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.""

When asked if the shipyard is concerned by dwindling numbers of those entering the trades, Morin said the shipyard cannot speculate on the skill level of individuals in the area the shipyard ""Has the ability to train workers and develop the skills needed to meet mission requirements.""

SSA Vice Chairman Mike Ralston, who helped organize the visit to YCCC's tech center, said he's concerned about modern day stigmas surrounding the trades.

""I think guidance counselors and parents think the only way to go in life is a college education and I don't agree with that. These trades are vitally needed. We're just trying to do whatever we can to get people interested in the trades, with our ultimate goal as getting them hired on the shipyard.""

""You've got to have a requisite level of skills to go work on a nuclear submarine,"" he continued.

Joyal said he hopes to put together a ""Regional brainstorming session,"" where those with vested interest can essentially troubleshoot ideas to strengthen workforce development as it relates to the shipyard.

""My main concern is making sure those feeder tubes to the shipyard don't dry up,"" he said.

Despite the uncertainty of future workforce flow, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard remains the largest employer in the Seacoast, totaling $751.8 million in economic activity in 2017.

Elected officials believe in the work they're doing.

On April 25, Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter announced the House Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act will include nearly $150 million for the shipyard to expand its capacity to repair the most modern generation of Navy submarines, the Virginia class.

Shea-Porter said while the new investments in the shipyard are great news for the Seacoast, ""The nationwide shortage of skilled labor is felt acutely in our region, posing new challenges for the shipyard and straining the human resource offices responsible for processing new hires. The result is a hiring process that can take months just to on-board a single new employee in an environment where potential new hires have lots of job options, leading some to seek employment elsewhere.""

Shea-Porter has worked on the House Armed Services Committee to explore new options for expedited hiring, including expanded use of Direct Hiring Authority, which will help the shipyard bypass a ""Cumbersome hiring process."" In addition, she recently worked to reauthorize the Perkins Act, which supports state career technical education programs that train the next generation of skilled workers."
586,Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,5/7/2018 19:06,"Enrollment in the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship program reached an all-time high in the 2017-18 school year, and YA ambassadors like Kerrie Marquardt, a Supply Chain Solutions Instructor Fox Valley Technical College, are advancing the work-based learning program for the benefit of students and employers alike.

Not only does Marquardt help connect students to local YA programs in her current job as an instructor, she helped drive success of the program as a high school YA student more than 20 years ago.

""When the Youth Apprenticeship Program was offered for the first time in my school, I knew this was an opportunity for me to expand my high school experience,"" she said.

""At this point in my life I knew I wanted to do something either in business or teaching. I also wanted to find an employer that was close to school to allow me to still be active in sports and extracurricular activities.""

Marquardt found that balance as a Youth Apprentice for Premier Bank in the Northeast Wisconsin community of Marion.

She applied what she learned in the classroom with work-based learning that was fun, challenging and rewarding.

""I had the opportunity to learn the different areas of the bank including teller, opening up accounts, bookkeeping, loans and marketing,"" she said.

""I gained a number of mentors along the way that also took the time to get to know me as a person and at times knew me better than I knew myself. So, they were always challenging me to do things out of my comfort zone and encourage me to do my best.""

Marquardt's YA experience gave her greater confidence and self-awareness as she planned for life after she graduated from high school in 1997.""The YA Program helped me identify my strength and weakness early on in life, that lead me to the""right fit"" degree in college,"" Marquardt said.

"" The YA Program gives students the tools they need to be successful both personally and professionally before they even graduate high school.

Marquardt went on to earn a degree in organizational communication from UW-Green Bay.

After nearly a decade working in business, she was offered the opportunity to teach Supply Chain Management at FVTC. The position gives her the opportunity to promote YA programs to students in area K-12 schools.

""I am at a point in my career where I want to give back to a program that I truly believe in and has shaped who I am today,"" she said.

"" It is very important for me to create awareness of the amazing career opportunities in Supply Chain Management in order to fill the current talent shortages area business are seeing.

Marquardt recently shared her experience and ideas for the YA program as a featured presenter at the Department of Workforce Development's 2018 Youth Apprenticeship Forum.

""I wanted to share my vision on how we can increase the number of Youth Apprenticeship students graduating in the Transportation, Distribution and Logistics in Wisconsin, in a high demand career field,"" she said.

""My vision is to have Youth Apprenticeship students working in the Supply Chain field gaining experience in different areas of the business during their 2 years depending on their areas of interests. I could see a student working in areas like purchasing, engineering, quality assurance, shipping and receiving, transportation, production scheduler or assembly.""

Youth Apprenticeship opportunities in Wisconsin cover a wide range of career fields from manufacturing to hospitality to healthcare, agriculture and transportation.

There are 10 career clusters that cover a total 50 career pathways.

To get started, she recommends that students talk directly with their school's guidance counselor to identify their region's Youth Apprenticeship Coordinator.

That individual's job is to coordinate the efforts of the many partners involved with serving students in local YA consortiums across particular regions.

""I've seen first-hand the importance of creating strong collaborations/partnerships between K12, higher education and the business community,"" she said.

""I knew I wanted to be a part of that somehow, but just didn't know where my life journey would take me.""

For centuries, an apprentice trained under an expert craftsman mastering the technology of the times in civilizations throughout the world.

The modern apprentice reunites these processes in the disciplines of electromechanical technology, mechanical technology, machining, metal fabrication, and more for a new generation of artisans.

Northeast State and the Regional Center for Advanced Manufacturing enable this ages-old tradition by becoming the first community college in Tennessee to sponsor registered apprenticeship programs to provide small- and mid-sized employers with a structured training process using the U.S. Department of Labor Standards of Apprenticeship.

""We're able to put DOL registered apprenticeship structure together for them and deliver it as a turn-key package,"" said Jeff Frazier, RCAM dean.

""We can offer it to any size company whether it has one apprenticeship or 20. This allows them to take advantage of the same level of training available to Fortune 500 companies.""

RCAM is a registered apprenticeship sponsor, meaning it can put together a training package - per DOL guidelines - for companies of any size.

This training is especially valuable for smaller companies and entrepreneurs that might not otherwise be able to offer or sustain an apprenticeship program.

At the end of the program, the workers receive a DOL certificate of completion.

The newest asset to the apprentice program is the RCAM Academy, a 15,000-square-foot facility stands behind the current RCAM building.

Area high school students can take advantage of these new dual enrollment options to earn college credit hours during their junior and senior years.

The Academy opened to students with spring with a mission to support advanced manufacturing at a whole new level.

The RCAM sponsored their first apprenticeship program in the spring of 2017 when Kingsport's Silgan Closures entered into a registered apprenticeship program in RCAM's mechatronics technician program.

Silgan employees participating in the four-year program receive classroom instruction at RCAM and on-the-job training from Silgan.

Programs are established as ""Group Apprenticeship Programs"" enabling companies of all sizes to take advantage of apprenticeship training, without the burden of managing a company sponsored program.

RCAM welcomed its second partner in August 2017 when Primester GP of Kingsport signed on to train their own Mechatronics Technician apprentices.

Participating partners become an Authorized Training Agent by signing the Employer Acceptance Agreement provided by Northeast State and RCAM. Partners provide training opportunities for all apprentices drawn from their employees or new hires.

Mechatronics - a discipline known familiarly as Electromechanical Technology - combines the knowledge of mechanical technology with the knowledge of electrical technology and electronic circuits.

Mechantronics technicians perform critical maintenance and repairs on complex systems that use robotics, Programmable Logic Controllers, hydraulics/pneumatics, and electrical/electronic circuits.

The versatility of the mechatronics technician skill set enables an apprentice to ply his or her skills in the sectors of biotechnology; energy; chemical and petroleum refining; industrial machinery; and aerospace technology among many others.

Each of the Silgan and Primester apprentices was nominated to apply by their company.

They completed RCAM's application process, which requires a work history, the ACT WorkKeys exam, and an interview.

Apprentices must attend and pass coursework off-hours, demonstrate progress in his or her job, and submit monthly work progress reports.

Each employee completing a sponsored apprenticeship will be awarded a DOL certificate of completion.

Partners also identify master craft professionals to mentor apprentice(s).

According to the Labor Department, the apprenticeship benefits are substantial.

Companies that use such programs can diversify their workforce, improve productivity and profitability, standardize training, reduce turnover, receive tax credits, and more.

RCAM envisions future apprenticeship programs to include injection molding process technician, precision machinist, electromechanical technician, tool and die maker, CNC operator, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician among others.

From careers in healthcare, energy and IT, to manufacturing, transportation and more, Northeast State and RCAM foresee the registered apprenticeship sponsorship as a critical tool for innovative new companies to compete in the global marketplace."
594,Sen. Chris Coons et al,5/8/2018 9:30,"In Washington, the most common conversation topic should be a simple one: jobs.  How do we create more of them? How do we prepare Americans for the jobs that are already available? How do we ensure those jobs provide a decent wage and good benefits?  In Congress, these conversations often lead to discussions on the importance of expanding early childhood education, strengthening our public schools, and making college more affordable. And to be sure, those investments are critical.  But let?s not forget about another straightforward, proven way to train Americans for well-paying jobs and lifelong careers: apprenticeships, sometimes called ?the other four-year degree.?

According to the National Skills Coalition, there are 5.9 million job openings in the United States, and 6.6 million unemployed Americans. The skills gap is a major reason why these jobs continue to go unfilled, especially for those jobs that don?t require a four-year college degree. But apprenticeships can help address this.  As a U.S. senator from Delaware who spent ten years in county government, and as the expert craftsmen and women of This Old House, we?ve seen firsthand that apprenticeships can help address these issues. Apprenticeships are one of our oldest forms of education?and still one of the smartest investments we can make."

Englishman Electric reactivated its program, the state Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation announced Tuesday.

The number of registered apprentices in the state has jumped 20 percent, to about 9,600, since January 2015, the labor department said.

The latest round of sponsors will offer training for machinists; heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration technicians; electricians; plumbers; cement masons; ironworkers; operating engineers; and certified cyber analyst operators.

""Apprenticeship offers job seekers the chance to learn new skills while earning a wage, and employers the opportunity to build their workforce while reducing turnover costs,"" Kelly M. Schulz, state labor secretary, said in the announcement.

The full-time jobs offered through the programs include on-the-job training and classroom instruction.

Programs are open to anyone 18 or older, with youth apprenticeships open to high school students.

Once you've decided on an industry and the level, you have to go through an individual application process for every different company, in the hope of finding out that suits you.  So before you even start, it's good to know what apprenticeships are worth applying to and which ones aren't.

The website has collated a Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers table, based on reviews from existing apprentices, which identifies the best employers for students hoping to do one.

606,Staff,5/9/2018 10:48,"According to the U.S. Department of Labor there are nearly 16,000 active apprentices earning while learning in Michigan companies.

In the past year, Michigan saw 42 new companies register apprenticeship programs and 2,300 apprentices begin their journeys in various industries.

With more than 1,000 occupations recognized as apprenticeable, the opportunity for businesses to develop the talent they need is well within reach.

Some business owners and HR professionals still hesitate to embrace apprenticeship based on the misleading perception that registering an apprenticeship program can be an expensive or onerous process.

The Advance Michigan Center for Apprenticeship Innovation and its partners seek to disprove those perceptions.

Accordingly, AMCAI held the first Apprenticeship in a Day workshop in collaboration with the Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship, Michigan Educator's Apprenticeship and Training Association and Southeast Michigan Community Alliance.

The event, held in early April, demonstrated how streamlined the process can be.

This workshop served as a pilot for a larger AiD event happening at the upcoming MEATA Spring 2018 Apprenticeship Conference, scheduled for May 22-25 in Traverse City, where approximately 20 businesses will participate in the first official Apprenticeship in a Day workshop.

During the half-day AiD pilot in April, four companies were taken through the steps to build their Apprenticeship Standards and customize their program's required on-the-job and classroom learning, and were offered information about potential funding support.

Decision makers were in attendance from the business community, as well as USDOL OA Apprenticeship Training Representatives, community college apprenticeship coordinators who assisted with the development of Related Technical Instruction and Michigan Works! Business Services Representatives.

Key components of an apprenticeship program were established for all businesses that participated in the event, such as acceptance qualifications, apprentice supervision, wage progression and related technical instruction.

Of the four companies participating, two officially registered their apprenticeship programs with fully signed DOL apprenticeship standards, a third employer obtained final signatures within days of the event and one employer gained the knowledge necessary to add additional occupations to an apprenticeship program the company had already established.

Patrick M. Lambrix, human resource manager for TWB Co. LLC in Monroe, officially registered TWB's mechatronics apprenticeship.

""We had been toying with the paperwork to register our apprenticeship for the past six months to address the skills gap we're facing, especially as many of our workers near retirement,"" Lambrix said.

""Having all of the resources we needed in one room helped us finalize our RTI and tackle some of the finer details we needed to address. If any business is on the fence about registered apprenticeship, this workshop will be the decisive point for them to move forward.""

Dana Beaurem, human resource manager, and Dave Ridgeway, maintenance supervisor for ArcelorMittal in Detroit, also took advantage of the day's comprehensive resources to gain official signoff on the company's registered apprenticeship.

""I didn't expect so much detail. What I had trouble figuring out on my own, I could tap into the expertise in the room to finalize in hours,"" Beaurem said.

""Apprenticeship is a must, and this was the perfect way to expedite the process and get all of your questions answered in one place. It was also beneficial to learn about the funding resources that may be available to us.""

""On my own, it didn't click how easily registering an apprenticeship comes together,"" said Diahann Stanfied, human resources manager for Standard Die International in Livonia.

""Working with Heather and Marybeth got me where I needed to be, and I'm looking forward to finalizing the registration of our apprenticeship very soon.""

""I came to the Apprenticeship in a Day workshop to get a better understanding of the process for establishing and revising an apprenticeship program, because we already had registered apprenticeships we wanted to modify to better suit new needs at the company,"" said John Tucker, director of human resources for PTM Corp. in Fair Haven.

""With the information provided, I have what I need to go back to my company to amend our standards and begin adding new roles.""

Not only did these companies benefit from the Apprenticeship in a Day workshop, WIN also added a new occupation to its registered apprenticeship program: workforce development analyst.

Developed with support from WIN's research team, two individuals are already identified to be enrolled.

This is the second occupation in WIN's registered apprenticeship program, along with workforce development specialist, an occupation with two current apprentices at WIN. Companies interested in developing or finalizing a registered apprenticeship are still eligible to register for the MEATA Spring 2018 Apprenticeship Conference for the Apprenticeship in a Day workshop taking place May 24.

""I can't say enough how much I hope our students and their parents will be open to the variety of careers that are available for them here in our state,"" she said.

""Take a look at the world of trades today as opposed to the world of trades many of us grew up looking at. It's changed so much. That mindset, 'I don't want my child to work in a CNC factory,' because we have images of old shoe factories in our mind.""

Canada noted how lucrative many trades jobs can be and most workers don't bear the burden of crippling student debt.

In 2017 alone, according to shipyard Public Affairs Specialist Libby Morin, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard reached more than 18,000 students and potential future employees through its workforce development efforts.

""Portsmouth Naval Shipyard consistently works to strengthen our community relationships in the development of our future workforce,"" Morin said.

""Over the years our STEM mentors have interacted with thousands of students at dozens of K-12 schools and universities, children's museums, public libraries and various youth organizations in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.""

When asked if the shipyard is concerned by dwindling numbers of those entering the trades, Morin said the shipyard cannot speculate on the skill level of individuals in the area the shipyard ""Has the ability to train workers and develop the skills needed to meet mission requirements.""

""I think guidance counselors and parents think the only way to go in life is a college education and I don't agree with that. These trades are vitally needed. We're just trying to do whatever we can to get people interested in the trades, with our ultimate goal as getting them hired on the shipyard.""

""You've got to have a requisite level of skills to go work on a nuclear submarine,"" he continued.

Joyal said he hopes to put together a ""Regional brainstorming session,"" where those with vested interest can essentially troubleshoot ideas to strengthen workforce development as it relates to the shipyard.

""My main concern is making sure those feeder tubes to the shipyard don't dry up,"" he said.

Despite the uncertainty of future workforce flow, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard remains the largest employer in the Seacoast, totaling $751.8 million in economic activity in 2017.

Elected officials believe in the work they're doing.

On April 25, Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter announced the House Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act will include nearly $150 million for the shipyard to expand its capacity to repair the most modern generation of Navy submarines, the Virginia class.

Shea-Porter said while the new investments in the shipyard are great news for the Seacoast, ""The nationwide shortage of skilled labor is felt acutely in our region, posing new challenges for the shipyard and straining the human resource offices responsible for processing new hires. The result is a hiring process that can take months just to on-board a single new employee in an environment where potential new hires have lots of job options, leading some to seek employment elsewhere.""

Shea-Porter has worked on the House Armed Services Committee to explore new options for expedited hiring, including expanded use of Direct Hiring Authority, which will help the shipyard bypass a ""Cumbersome hiring process."" In addition, she recently worked to reauthorize the Perkins Act, which supports state career technical education programs that train the next generation of skilled workers.

617,OSEC,5/10/2018 12:00,"President Donald J. Trump?s Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion today submitted a report to the President providing a strategy to create more apprenticeships in the United States through an Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship model.  Members of the Task Force ? representing business, labor, trade and industry groups, educational institutions, and public officials ? approved the report during their fifth and final full meeting.

?President Trump?s Administration is committed to bridging the skills gap by creating apprenticeships that reflect the needs of jobs creators,? said U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta. ?The Task Force established through the President?s Executive Order brought together varied perspectives to create a strategy for expanding apprenticeships across all industries. I am grateful to the Task Force members for sharing expertise and insight that shaped this final report, which provides a road map to help Americans learn the skills they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow.?

?Apprenticeships give students proven and meaningful ways to gain skills and kickstart fulfilling careers,? said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ?I?m excited by the proposals the Task Force on Apprenticeships is putting forward to the President. We must continue our efforts to strengthen workforce readiness and increase the number of pathways available to students after high school.?

?The current half a million apprentices are simply not enough to fill the more than 6 million unfilled jobs at U.S. companies in today?s labor market,? said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. ?This thoughtful, practical strategy will make 2018 an inflection point that helps solve today?s labor market challenges and creates the workforce of the future.?

Apprenticeship programs, when implemented effectively, provide workers with a career path featuring paid on-the-job instruction, skills development, and mentorship, while at the same time providing employers with a steady source of highly trained and productive workers. These programs have the potential to grow into a critical and successful component of America?s workforce strategy, but are currently underutilized.  To help more Americans learn relevant skills for family-sustaining jobs, the President?s Executive Order called for the Secretary of Labor to establish a Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion. The mission of the Task Force was to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeships are insufficient."
618,Liisa Rajala,5/10/2018 14:00,"If you?re looking to change careers, an apprenticeship may be the best way to explore a new industry, and there couldn?t be a better time.  In 2017, the Community College System of New Hampshire obtained a $1.2 million U.S. Department of Labor grant to expand apprenticeships in the state.  CCSNH is focused on partnering with employers to create apprenticeships in three growing industries: health care, information technology and advanced manufacturing.

Apprenticeships can take anywhere from one year to six years to complete. Apprenticeship programs require a minimum of 144 hours (or 18 8-hour days) of classroom learning and 2,000 hours (or 50 weeks) of paid on-the-job training.  Apprentices receive a paycheck from day one that increases incrementally as skill levels increase. Upon completing an apprenticeship, individuals can earn up to $60,000 a year."
627,West Virginia Executive,5/11/2018 11:07,"More than 400 small business owners, company representatives and other critical workforce development partners attended the Apprenticeship In Motion Program's series of statewide summits over the past few weeks.

National experts who participated in the summits believe West Virginia is heading in the right direction when it comes to expanding the apprenticeship model and closing the gap for its diversifying workforce.

""Our team was thrilled to be a part of this year's Apprenticeship In Motion summits around the Mountain State,"" said Michael Prebil, program manager for New America, a think tank that invests in new thinkers and new ideas to address the next generation of challenges facing the United States.

The summits, which took place across the state in April and May, trained companies and small businesses in the West Virginia on how to integrate the apprenticeship model into their human resource practices.

Summit attendees heard from senior business leaders from across the country about why apprenticeship has been an effective training model in their workplaces.

Prebil continued, ""Nationally, we've seen tremendous interest in expanding the apprenticeship model to meet the needs of our diversifying workforce. We're so excited that West Virginians have seized this opportunity through their AIM program to serve as apprenticeship leaders on the national stage.""

AIM is the result of the cooperative teamwork of the West Virginia Development Office, West Virginia Department of Education, WorkForce West Virginia, the Robert C. Byrd Institute at Marshall University and the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia.

The working group of partners identify, standardize and develop courses that are needed statewide to provide companies the tools and resources they need to integrate apprenticeship programs into their current training and human resources strategies.

The Apprenticeship In Motion program is being funded through a grant obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor."

Offering GED and Apprenticeship Programs was naturally beneficial to them.

Every truly successful company knows that and a good way for companies to show appreciation is through an apprenticeship program.

Phaze Concrete works diligently to offer their employees as many opportunities as they can.

This company, among others, have come together to help the morale, education, and quality of life for their employees.

Offering programs such as the GED and apprenticeship guidance help to boost the morale of the team.

When a company encourages their employees to seek higher education, it shows that they care about them personally.

It raises morale and with it, the loyalty that employees have for a company.

Phaze Concrete wants to ensure that the morale of their employees is always high.

The company tries their best to let their employees know how much they appreciate them.

With every decision they make, the company's goal is to dissuade employees from thinking that their work is, ""Just a job"".

That is why offering GED and apprenticeship programs are so important to Phaze Concrete.

The company strives to do everything they can to make their employees feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing.

An educated mind is a powerful tool; both on the job and throughout the employee's personal life.

631,Hadley Barndollar,5/11/2018 23:34,"KITTERY, Maine One hundred and thirty-four graduated from Portsmouth Naval Shipyard's two apprenticeship programs Friday night, entering a workforce that nears a strength of 6,000, the Seacoast's largest employment site.

The class of 2018 represented 21 different trades; 91 graduates from the four-year Trades Apprentice Program and 43 from the five-year Workers Skills Progression Program.

Currently, there are more than 1,220 participants in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard's apprenticeship programs, according to shipyard officials.

Families and friends gathered at Friday's ceremony to congratulate the newest members of the shipyard workforce, which demonstrates ""Maritime superiority"" working on the nation's submarines.

""This is an important personal accomplishment for each of you, having successfully completed the challenging on-the-job and classroom training requirements for our submarine repair,"" said shipyard Commander Capt. David Hunt.

""Today you officially join the ranks of the dedicated, highly-skilled professional men and women who are the building blocks of our naval shipyards.""

Hunt told the graduates they have chosen a demanding career path, as the complex work done by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard ""Is without equal.""

""You must never lose sight that the safety of our Navy sailors and our national defense depends on you now,"" he said.

""Each of you must do the right thing the first time, and every time.""

Hunt called the shipyard a ""Gold standard in submarine maintenance.""

Sharon Smoot, of Naval Sea Systems Command, said in the last decade, the nation has doubled the amount of work expected by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

""One of the things I am most proud of besides the work that you guys do every day, is I know that when that submarine leaves this waterfront, everything on that submarine is going to do whats its supposed to do,"" Smoot said.

""I never worry about the work that you do protecting the sailors that are protecting us. That is a huge sense of pride.""

Smoot told the graduates that ""There is no quiet time and you will not be bored. Your waterfronts will be full.""

""I encourage you to be ready to be in front of the problems that we dont see right now,"" she continued.

""To solve them, to solve them before they catch us. I encourage you to embrace every opportunity youre given to lead, to lead in your shops, in departments, in project teams, in your communities of practice. I need you to lead at every level of this shipyard.""

Class spokesman Maxwell DeMilner, a fabric worker, told his classmates they should be proud of how far they've come, but also recognized the work that lies ahead. ""When we first came on yard, we were not professional submarine mechanics,"" he said.

""We were sales clerks, bartenders, customer service reps. But regardless of our different backgrounds, we all came to the shipyard for the same season. We wanted better jobs, better careers, better lives.""

The apprentices were told they must be the best, he said, and anything less was unacceptable.

""We have taken the shipyards mission and made it our own,"" DeMilner said.

""We will be the best, we are proud of our past, we are ready for the future. We are Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.""

A resident of Lyman, Maine, Sarah Enos graduated Friday night from the Trades Apprenticeship Program as a marine electrician.

She'd had no prior experience, she said, and actually came from the pharmaceutical field.

The outstanding graduate awards were given to Scott Hanson in the Workers Skills Progression Program and Travis Thurber in the Trades Apprentice Program."
632,Dan O'Brien,5/12/2018 5:00,"FARRELL, Pa. - The vast majority of African Americans own a smart phone and an equally large percentage of black households contain a computer.

While African Americans are leading the way in terms of consumer trends in the tech industry, they've been shut out of the job market when it comes to careers with Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Twitter or Facebook, the CEO and president of the National Urban League said Friday.

""African Americans trail when it comes to employment in these West Coast tech firms,"" said Marc H. Morial, who has served as the National Urban League's CEO since 2002.

Morial addressed reporters during a press event Friday at the Shenango Valley Urban League to discuss the organization's annual State of Black America report, released May 4.

The report uses an equality index to measure how blacks fare when compared to whites in areas such as housing, education, economics and social justice.

The CEO also served as the keynote speaker for the Shenango Valley Urban League's 50th anniversary banquet, held Thursday evening.

This year's report devoted a special focus to digital inclusion, finding that while black consumers are helping to power the country's tech industry, the number of African Americans employed in tech jobs is far fewer when compared with whites.

According to the report, about 90% of African Americans own smartphones and 89.3% of black households have a computer.

The percentage of blacks actually employed in the tech industry is quite small, Morial said.

""Google, Twitter and Facebook combined have over 40,000 employees,"" Morial said.

""Less than 1,000 of them are African American.""

Less than 5% of the overall workforce of the country's major tech companies is black, the report continued, while nearly 50% is white.

The lack of inclusion to high-paying tech jobs in turn has an impact on the overall household income of African American families.

In 2018, the average median income for white households stood at $63,155 compared to just $38,555 for African American households.

On the other hand, those companies considered ""Legacy"" firms, such as broadband providers Comcast, Spectrum, AT&T, Verizon and Charter, have embraced diversity and have embedded diversity programs within their human resources departments.

""But if these companies can achieve diversity, so too can Google, Twitter, and Facebook.""

""We're encouraging these companies to embrace diversity and to hire in a way that reflects America and also in a way that reflects their consumers,"" he said.

The report also sheds light on racial inequality in other sectors, and notes that slight improvements have been made in economics and education since the previous year's survey.

African Americans suffered slight setbacks in health care.

Still, the overall status of black Americans hasn't changed much, especially in the context of the current political environment, said Morial, who served as Mayor of New Orleans during the mid-1990s.

He said people are becoming more aware of this because digital technology has enabled rapid communication across social media platforms.

Headline-grabbing incidents such as the arrests of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia for sitting in the cafu00e9 without ordering drew widespread attention because the episode was recorded on a cell phone and went viral.

""The fact that many of these incidents are more transparent forces people to be more accountable,"" Morial said.

""I think it was remarkable how quickly Starbucks responded to the incident.""

Morial said the company demonstrated the sort of corporate responsibility that others should emulate.

The political and policy winds in Washington are complicating issues for the country's most vulnerable.

""There's no question in this political environment, hate incidents have risen,"" he said, citing figures compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and incidents of hate crimes every year.

Morial said it doesn't make sense to cut programs - such as the Women, Infant and Children, or WIC - for people who need them the most when Congress has approved a tax cuts that benefit corporations and the wealthiest Americans.

Erin Houston, the Shenango Valley Urban League's president and CEO, said the local chapter is a vital component of the community, especially through its WIC program.

""We serve 3,200 women every year,"" Houston said.

""There are also other programs that impact health, wellness and housing.""

An important initiative ready to relaunch this summer is the Youth Apprenticeship program, Houston noted.

The program enrolls students ages 12 through 15 and introduces them to basic communications skills, interviewing skills and other aptitudes needed to be successful in securing a job.

""We want to giver them this experience before they're work-age eligible,"" Houston said.

Morial said the Urban League has excelled in helping young people get through high school and move on to post-secondary education, Morial said.

The organization has in addition made great efforts helping people with financial literacy and housing issues, job training and workforce development, and small-business assistance through its Urban League Entrepreneurship Centers.

""Our financial literacy program is focused on home ownership,"" he said.

Before the Great Recession hit in 2008, the organization was helping 2,500 people a year get into stable mortgage loan products with a fixed interest rate.

""About 1/3 of our clients were white,"" he said.

Among the biggest hurdles is finding the funding to maintain most of these programs, Morial said, since all of the Urban League's services are free of charge."
633,Richard Craver,5/12/2018 19:15,"Although the patience-is-a-virtue strategy extends to its hiring plans, Egger is wasting little time in trying to attract the first wave of local high school students and other potential workers into an education pipeline for its initial 400 advanced manufacturing jobs.

That's because Egger's apprenticeship program for the electrical and mechanical trades requires a four-year commitment, beginning this fall.

Students will be paid throughout the apprenticeship, gain full benefits, earn an associate degree from Davidson County Community College, get a guaranteed job offer upon completion and receive a $2,000 signing bonus.

""Finding the right people to work for us is a priority as we establish our U.S. presence,"" said Karl Grasser, the Egger official responsible for finance and administration for the Linwood complex.

On Tuesday, an information night will begin at 6 p.m. on Davidson County Community College's Thomasville campus, located at 297 DCC Road, that will unveil Egger's apprenticeship training program, primarily to rising juniors and seniors and their parents.

Egger is among an increasing number of Triad employers putting more emphasis on apprenticeship programs as a way to attract young adults to a career in manufacturing or the trades.

""In Europe, an apprenticeship is a highly sought opportunity because of the hiring commitment from the employer, and the skills that are taught are transferable into plenty of trades,"" said Margaret Annunziata, DCCC's vice president for academic programs and services.

Grasser said Egger's apprenticeship program will give potential employees hands-on training in a safe environment on the equipment they will be using on the production floor.

The process will lean toward classroom time at first before shifting toward more work experience over time.

DCCC held its second annual apprenticeship summit on April 27 to encourage programs in construction, health care, information technology and manufacturing.

""Apprenticeship programs benefit any industry with career paths that require employees acquire additional skills on the job in addition to gaining academic knowledge,"" said Carolyn Davis, the program director for corporate training and workforce development at DCCC. For example, the Egger apprenticeship will emphasize classroom training with an element of hands-on training.

""The Egger apprenticeship model is one that allows motivated students to receive a high-quality education and develop the skills leading to rewarding careers,"" said Craig Goodson, the president and chief executive of the Davidson economic development group.

""If we can get North Carolina's K-12 education program more closely aligned with community colleges and private industry apprenticeship programs, we will create a sustained, dependable and highly valued workforce,"" Goodson said.

""We want to not only get the apprenticeship pipeline flowing, but we want it to be constantly filling every year to establish a high quality and dependable work force,"" he said.

Some Triad companies have adopted variations of the European apprenticeship philosophy, which typically identifies students as young as middle school for a trade career.

Todd Bishop, the dean of the engineering technology program at Forsyth Technical Community College, said its apprenticeship program assists Grass America in Kernersville and Siemens Energy and Wieland Cooper Products, both of Rural Hall.

Forsyth Tech offers a production technician program, a state-registered preapprenticeship program that provides companies with skilled, entry-level talent.

Starting this summer, the program will provide a pathway for high school graduates.

Forsyth Tech operates a 30,000-square-foot center for advanced manufacturing on its main Silas Creek Parkway campus.

""The biggest problem we have with the apprenticeships is attracting enough applicants into the pipeline,"" Bishop said.

""Most times, the student is in the classroom two full semesters before going out onto the work floor in a part-time role,"" Bishop said.

Students can earn a journeyman certificate from the N.C. Department Commerce and an associate degree in manufacturing technology from Rockingham Community College.

""We're trying to change the definition of manufacturing to combat the perception of what an advanced manufacturing involves and what it pays,"" said Lydia Craddock, the lead official for the RockATop apprenticeship program.

""Among employed completers, a higher proportion of those with an occupational credential report working in a job related to their field of study, compared to those with an academic credential,"" the center said.

The program will be supported in partnership with Guild Education, an adult-education company.

The goal is to expand the program to qualified Lowe's part- and full-time employees nationwide by the end of 2018.

That can include a family member having their manufacturing job taken offshore, decreasing consumer demand for housing and commercial developments, or homeowners putting off maintenance and repair work to save money.

Another obstacle to attracting young adults is the knowledge that it is hard work, sometimes in risky environments with tools that require a careful, steady hand.

""With these apprenticeship programs, students can come out with a job, debt-free, working in a clean environment, and with the technical and soft skills employers are clamoring for,"" he said.

""We offer students and parents tours of these facilities so they can see the work environment firsthand,"" Craddock said.

The minimum base salary for apprenticeship graduates is $34,000 a year.

Surry Community College said eight of its engineering students were hired in April to work in the merchandising displays division of WestRock's operations in Winston-Salem.

Five were in SCC's mechatronics engineering technology program, while three were in electrical-systems technology program.

Mechatronics is defined by SCC as ""Taking the electronics, mechanical and robotics part of advanced manufacturing and teaching students how they tie together."" SCC said that workers skilled in mechatronics typically start at $25 an hour.

""Our maintenance department was in need of highly trained, quality people, and you were able to step in and fill that need,"" Veronica Hritz, WestRock's local human-resources administrator, said of the SCC apprenticeship program.

The programs are tuition-free for high school juniors and seniors at SCC's Dobson and Yadkinville campuses.

Each program offers a two-year degree, one-year diploma and certificate options.

Doug Slate, the lead mechatronics instructor at SCC, said students in that program ""Need to be self-motivated individuals who are inquisitive and want to know how things work and like to work with their hands.""

SCC's electrical-systems apprenticeship program typically takes two years to complete and offers a pathway for earning a double associate degree.

""Graduates of the electrical-systems program at Surry Community College qualify to do most anything in the electrical field,"" said Jerry Boles, the program's lead instructor."

Unfortunately, the U.S. is not embracing them with the zeal of other industrialized nations.  The recent Pennsylvania College of Technology Apprenticeship Summit brought together business experts, entrepreneurs and educators for an opportunity to seriously consider the training programs.

Robert Lerman, institute fellow with the Urban Institute, said apprenticeships give those looking to be hired with a company the chance to apply their learning to real-life work situations.  ?It is a very effective model,? he said. ?There is a strong incentive to perform well.?  The investments in apprenticeships, in many cases, result in paying for themselves."

Jacob and Zach will continue working with Ardent Mills until early fall to complete the on-the-job hours required for apprenticeship certificates.

Next: they will be ready for their professional milling careers.

According to U.S. Department of Education, people with technical educations are more likely to be employed than their counterparts with academic credentials, and they are significantly more likely to be working in their fields of study.

What's more: The two apprentices will enter their careers free of school loans.

These ""Apprenticeship advantages"" are part of what motivated Brad Allen.

Vice president and operations lead, Ardent Mills, and Ted Korolchuk.

Technical fellow, Ardent Mills, to launch an apprenticeship program at two community mills.

Another motivation was the need for skilled millers.

""We worked with Buhler Industries Inc., a company that already had experience starting an apprenticeship with Dunwoody, to adapt their program for our apprentices,"" explains, Christy Ball., talent and skills development analyst, Ardent Mills.

""Jacob and Zach took not-for-credit courses and completed on the job training in flour milling to earn Certificates of Apprenticeship from the Minnesota. department of Labor and Industry.""

Ardent Mills reached out to area high school guidance counselors and local leaders with the National FFA Organization, formerly known as Future Farmers of America, to identify candidates who were bright, eager and ready to ""Roll up their sleeves."" Both Jacob and Zach fit the bill.

""Jacob has been a sponge for knowledge from day one,"" reports Bobby Blaser.

Plant manager at Ardent Mills Lake City community mill.

""He excels in our world because of his keen analytical sense and strong mechanical aptitude. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching him grow in the team environment as well as sharpen his communication and leadership skills.""

Blaser also explains that Ardent Mills' new apprenticeship has provided learning experiences for everyone involved, not just the students.

""The apprenticeship program has helped accelerate the growth process for key individuals in our plant,"" Blaser says.

""In turn, this helps to fill a much-needed role through technical knowledge, growth, and aspirational leadership to enable us to reach our goals.""

""He is driven and eager to learn,"" says Tyler Adair.

""He got inside our mill and got hands-on learning supported by Dunwoody coursework. Being in a mill is the best way to learn the job. He sought challenges and reached outside his comfort zone.""

""Any of our mills will be lucky to have Jacob and Zach on board, and we are hopeful that we can continue this type of partnership to get more people interested in milling jobs,"" says Ball.

644,Staff,5/14/2018 19:31,"WASHINGTON - Apprenticeship programs could help address the country's skills gap and labor shortage, but would require increased investment, diversity and awareness to do so, experts said Monday at a National League of Cities panel discussion on workforce and infrastructure in the nation's capital.

""Scaling and supporting apprenticeship programs is critical, as is making sure that we have that connection between vocational schools and the workforce in our cities,"" said Mark Stodola, NLC president and mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas.

""These goals and aspirations cannot be tackled by one mayor or one city council or one city councilman or even one organization. We've got to have a real partnership between all of us, together.""

Apprenticeship programs can be structured in different ways, but typically provide some type of on-the-job training in a vocational or trade skill-construction, for example, or welding-in conjunction with classroom instruction.

Programs exist nationwide and across multiple sectors, and are traditionally sponsored by employers and labor groups.

Many of the programs are underfunded, and city officials, who are well positioned to inform public school students about the apprenticeship options available to them, frequently aren't aware of all of the opportunities in their area, Stodola said.

That leads to a shortage of skilled workers who can take over for an aging workforce whose members are poised to retire en masse.

""When you think about that element of our workforce that's beginning to retire and the significant knowledge base they have in terms of skills that don't necessarily require a college degree...we are not training our workforce and adequately preparing them for taking over these kinds of jobs,"" he said.

""Whether it's in our high schools or our schools, we've got to find a better pipeline, and the federal government needs to be part of that partnership.""

Apprenticeship programs can be part of that solution, but have problems of their own that would require solutions, including underrepresentation of women and minorities in certain trade markets.

""There's pretty low unemployment in construction right now. It was about 6.5 percent in April,"" said Amy Blair, research director of the economic opportunities program at the Aspen Institute.

""At the same time, we have high unemployment among African-American men in particular and underrepresentation of African-Americans in the construction industry. And women are barely represented at all in the construction industry, so there's opportunity there.""

Much of that can be addressed through the contracting process, said David Mallino, director of LIUNA's legislative department.

""Through the contracting, you can drive the process,"" he said.

""You can say whether it's including disadvantaged communities. You can say whether it's including women.""

The NLC is ""Calling on Congress"" to be part of the solution, Stodola said, via a ""Rebuild With Us"" platform that focuses on infrastructure investment and includes four key areas, including workforce.

Bloomberg Law reported that according to ?sources familiar with the situation,? a new proposal from the Department of Labor would loosen a host of workplace regulations, including what?s known as the Hazardous Occupations Orders, which protects workers between the ages of 16 and 18 from long hours and prohibits them from receiving extended training in fields with heavy machinery and manufacturing that may put lives in danger.  Under this reported new plan, which Bloomberg Law also obtained in the form of a drafted regulation to corroborate their sources, a 16-year-old in an apprenticeship program would legally be able to operate a chainsaw or take a roofing job ? occupations that are hazardous for adults, let alone children. A Department of Labor spokesperson declined to comment or confirm the proposal to Bloomberg Law.

Teen Vogue reached out to the Department of Labor for comment. They responded with a link to their regulatory agenda report published this spring, entitled ?Expanding Apprenticeship and Employment Opportunities for 16- and 17-Year-Olds Under the FLSA,? along with their youth employment resources for their Wage and Hour Division.  As Bloomberg Law notes, optimists hope the relaxed regulations will spur job creation by allowing more young workers to enter the workplace unencumbered by safety regulations. But these regulations have a history, and it's dangerous to destroy them."
655,Matt Wickstrom,5/15/2018 14:53,"FRANKFORT, Ky. - Gov. Bevin today announced an innovative new registered apprenticeship pilot program aimed at strengthening social services careers throughout the commonwealth.

Labor Secretary Derrick Ramsey, Health and Family Services Acting Secretary Scott Brinkman, Personnel Secretary Tom Stephens, Department for Community Based Services Commissioner Adria Johnson, and Associate Commissioner for the Office of Career and Technical Education Laura Arnold joined Gov. Bevin to launch the program, which will provide increased opportunities for individuals pursuing a social services career in state government.

One of the first of its kind in the country, this initiative will offer paid apprenticeship opportunities in local Protection and Permanency and Family Support offices within DCBS, part of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.

The program will offer apprenticeships to young adults who are interested in pursuing a career in social services but may not have the opportunity to go to college, have never considered secondary education, or are impacted by generational poverty.

""Whether it's a junior in high school who is dreaming of a career that gives back to the community, or a college student looking for a pathway into the social services field, this apprenticeship program will fundamentally change the way that the Commonwealth of Kentucky recruits and trains public servants for rewarding careers within DCBS,"" said Gov. Bevin.

""Apprenticeships are a proven training model that will enhance the way we provide social services throughout the Commonwealth, and we are exploring other areas where we can further use this program to recruit and retain the next generation of public servants in Kentucky.""

The pilot program began earlier this year as a co-op for high school students interested in social services careers.

Curriculum will require a minimum of 144 classroom and 2,000 to 3,000 on-the-job training hours per year and will include opportunities within DCBS offices in Frankfort and across the state.

In addition to mid-career professionals, the program will be available to both high school and college students, and eligible high school juniors and seniors may enroll in the Department of Education's Tech Ready Apprenticeship for Careers in Kentucky to obtain dual secondary and postsecondary credits while earning an apprenticeship wage.

TRACK students and apprentices will have the option of choosing from one of three different positions within the Protection and Permanency and Family Support offices: Office Manager/Administrative Services, Human Social Services, and Human Family Services.

Participants will acquire working knowledge of each role through guided learning and rotations through each function area and position.

DCBS Commissioner Adria Johnson said the apprenticeship program is an innovative way to equip students with the tools they need to begin social services careers.

""We are so pleased to be a part of this collaboration to attract and train more social services staff,"" Commissioner Johnson said.

""Prospective social services workers get an in-depth education through this program - especially from pairing with our veteran front-line and central office staff. Human services is such a dynamic profession, and this apprenticeship program will help us prepare capable, compassionate caseworkers who are committed to helping Kentucky's children and families have a better life.""

Commissioner Johnson said the apprenticeship program will help DCBS to train and retain social services staff by removing the barriers to education and training that some applicants may face.

She said the program will ensure high standards for new employees who work directly with families.

""When P-12 education works together with postsecondary education and business, or in this case state government, we can pave the pathway for student's to have successful careers after high school,"" Interim Kentucky Education Commissioner Wayne Lewis said.

""Through the TRACK program, students get a head start on college by taking dual credit courses while still in high school; they gain on-the-job work experience that will make them more valuable in the workplace and provide employers with qualified workers; and they can earn a paycheck that can support additional education and training. This opportunity is a win for everyone involved.""

This unique partnership between the TRACK program and the Commonwealth allows students interested in a social services career to gain experience while they are obtaining their formal education and enables DCBS to train the workforce of tomorrow while providing opportunities to current students.

Acts as the governing body for registered apprenticeships in Kentucky and provides technical and consultative services to employers.

""The 'Kentucky Trained. Kentucky Built.' registered apprenticeship initiative focuses not only growing the apprenticeship model throughout the state, but engaging underserved populations to help fill critical industries in need of a shot in the arm,"" Secretary Ramsey said.

""This unique collaboration is helping to bring the power of apprenticeships to great careers within state government, and I applaud the DCBS for wanting to cultivate a new wave of public servants who will help move the Commonwealth forward. This program is one of the first of its kind in the nation, and I'm excited to showcase another way that Kentucky is pioneering solutions in workforce development through innovative ideas like this one.""

As the demand for skilled public employees increases, the Personnel Cabinet.

Is looking to apprenticeships to create a pipeline for entry-level workers in a variety of areas, and the model used by DCBS can be replicated across state government agencies.

""DCBS employees provide critical services in all of Kentucky's 120 counties,"" said Secretary Stephens.

""These critical positions are especially difficult to fill in a tight labor market. This program has the ability to change that. An apprenticeship program will help Kentuckians specifically prepare for these important jobs, and in turn, help better meet the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens. I'm truly excited about the possibilities this program will provide.""

Dr. Robert Lerman, an Institution Fellow at the Urban Institute, professor of economics at American University, and one of the nation's leading experts on apprenticeships, has long advocated for increased public investment into the apprenticeship model and praised the announcement.

""Kentucky is lucky to have outstanding leaders who are making apprenticeship expansion a top priority and who have a strong bias for action,"" said Dr. Lerman.

""Their efforts to scale up apprenticeships will widen productive opportunities for workers while increasing the success of Kentucky's businesses and nonprofit employers.""

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, for every dollar spent on apprenticeships, employers gain $1.47 in return through increased productivity, reduced waste, and greater front-line innovation.

""Simply put, apprenticeships within state government have the potential to bring important long-term cost savings to Kentucky taxpayers,"" Secretary Ramsey said.

""Apprenticing social services positions at the DCBS is only the beginning for implementing this training model in other agencies. Today's announcement is a huge victory for children and families across the Commonwealth.""

Interested Kentucky high school juniors and seniors can contact their guidance counselors to the begin the process of applying for Fall 2018 semester apprenticeships."

The highest number in the 79-year history of formal apprenticeship job training in the state.

Had approximately 53,000 active apprentices and is on track to double the number by the end of 2020.

""Apprenticeship programs provide workers with paid on-the-job training that can lead to good-paying careers and supply employers with skilled workers,"" said Secretary Lanier.

""We have made significant progress during this period of economic growth in strengthening existing apprenticeship opportunities - reflected by the nearly 50,000 apprentices in state-approved apprenticeships in the building trades - and in creating new programs in high-growth industries.""

""Apprentices who learn skilled trades will be the workers of the future who keep California's. economy strong.""

Each year over the past three years through the California Apprenticeship Initiative to promote the creation of new apprenticeship programs in transportation and logistics, advanced manufacturing, healthcare and information technology.

This initiative includes pre-apprenticeship programs which are designed to prepare individuals to enter registered apprenticeship programs through industry-based training and classroom instruction.

Pre-apprenticeship programs also broaden opportunities for underrepresented populations - including women and low-income individuals - to enter registered apprenticeship programs.

California Apprenticeship Initiative grantees have registered more than 900 apprentices and pre-apprenticeship programs have enrolled more than 2,000 participants.

""SEIU Locals are proud to sponsor high-quality registered apprenticeship training programs in early childhood education, healthcare and state civil service occupations and we will continue to support expanding apprenticeships that provide a high quality learning experience that leads to high quality jobs,"" said Roxanne Sanchez, President of SEIU California and SEIU Local 1021.

Over the next 10 years to fix roads, freeways and bridges throughout the state and improve public transportation - includes $5 million.

Per year for five years to expand pre-apprenticeship training programs.

These programs provide at-risk youth, women, veterans and the formerly incarcerated with training in the construction trades.

The job training proposal in the transportation package builds on the California Workforce Development Board's successful efforts in Proposition 39 pre-apprenticeship training pilots, called the High Road Construction Careers program.

Since 2014, this program has trained more than 1,100 at-risk youth, veterans and other disadvantaged job seekers in construction and green job skills through regional partnerships of building trades councils, workforce boards, community colleges, schools and community organizations.

Upon completion of the training, 875 were hired in construction employment or enrolled in higher education, including more than 330 of which joined a state-certified apprenticeship.

663,Governor Steve Bullock's Office,5/16/2018 12:50,"MONTANA - Governor Steve Bullock today announced that the State of Montana has awarded nearly $1 million in federal POWER grant awards to assist the community of Colstrip with workforce planning and worker training and to ensure the successful transition of the region to a diversified economy.

""We must ensure that Colstrip and other coal-impacted communities remain vibrant and viable areas of our state,"" said Governor Bullock.

""This opportunity to help Montanans be successful in a diversified economy will further stabilize and continue to strengthen the region's economy now and into the future.""

In response to the decline in coal mining employment and potential long-term impacts in the region, the Montana Department of Labor & Industry applied for the POWER grant through the U.S. Department of Labor's Dislocated Worker program to provide support for the local Colstrip community to achieve their economic development goals with a skilled and trained workforce.

""These grants are essential to make sure the workforce of coal-impacted communities has the skills and training necessary for Montana to sustain our economic strength,"" said Labor & Industry Commissioner Galen Hollenbaugh.

""We look forward to working with community partners across the region to achieve their economic development goals.""

The funding covers workforce training for Colstrip and other communities in Eastern Montana affected by coal-related layoffs, including the Northern Cheyenne, Crow, and Fort Peck Assiniboine & Sioux reservations.

The dollars will go directly towards training over 1,100 workers in 23 eastern and southcentral Montana counties for new jobs in a diversified economy.

In August 2017, Governor Bullock announced that the State of Montana had secured $2 million in funding immediately available through the POWER grant for planning efforts and for workforce training in the area.

Additional funding will go towards sub-grants to local and statewide entities to support curriculum development or innovative workforce training consistent with the Colstrip economic development plan.

A total of over $4.6 million could be made available to the State of Montana through the POWER grant.

MTDLI has expanded capacity in the Registered Apprenticeship program to recruit more businesses to be sponsors in the coal-impacted region, and hired a tribal workforce coordinator to work with dislocated workers on the Northern Cheyenne, Crow, and Fort Peck reservations.

""With some significant impacts on the horizon, it is encouraging to see some productive collaboration going on between the state and federal agencies, labor organizations, higher education and economic development groups in Coal Country,"" said Jim Atchison, Executive Director of SE MT Development based in Colstrip.

""When these impacts hit southeast Montana, every community in the state will feel the pinch. These grant funds will certainly help ease the pain and keep Montana workers in Montana.""

""This POWER Grant award will help make sure the communities and workers in Montana's coal country are better equipped for changes in the energy sector,"" said Al Ekblad of the Montana AFL-CIO. ""This funding is an important first step in that direction, so Montanans in coal-impacted areas have the job skill training they need to continue putting food on the table and can pay their bills.""

""I'm optimistic that we have some time and possibilities to look forward to,"" said Rosebud County Commissioner and Colstrip Community Impact Advisory Group participant Doug Martens.

""We don't have to do this by ourselves and this grant funding will help. We need to concentrate on the whole region and not only one economic area."""
664,Jorge Klor de Alva,5/17/2018 12:00,"Apprenticeships, which combine on-the-job training and academic coursework, are often considered the gold standard of workforce training and have attracted substantial bipartisan support.

In 2017 there were 533,607 active apprentices across 22,488 apprenticeship programs.

Community colleges-institutions that already represent one of the nation's most important venues for career and technical education-are presently considering what role they can play in satisfying the growing interest in apprenticeship programs.

Community colleges face cultural, organizational, and financial challenges in delivering and expanding apprenticeships, including developing relationships with employers, registering programs with the US Department of Labor, and facing potential competition from emerging entities called apprenticeship service providers.

Most of today's college students view having sucu00adcess in the workplace, earning a decent salary, and having a fulfilling career as key reasons for pursuu00ading higher education.

There is a growing belief that colleges are not adequately preparing students for the jobs and careers needed in the 21st century and that a substantial gap exists between the training and education America's college graduates receive and the skills today's labor market demands.

Of the many options being actively discussed to bridge the divide, apprenticeship programs are attractu00ading widespread bipartisan support.

Apprenticeships are often considered the ""Gold standard"" of workforce eduu00adcation.

Acquiring new skills in the workplace is accompanied by related trainu00ading, typically provided by an educational institution such as a community college or a trade organization such as a union.

In the past two years of his adminisu00adtration, President Barack Obama made apprenticeships a priority, directing well over $250 million to support apprenticeship programs.

Public two-year community colleges are already central to the nation's career and technical education system, granting hundreds of thousands of occupau00adtionally oriented certificates and technically focused associate degrees.

Many community college leaders have welcomed the administration's call for apprenu00adticeship programs, and some have already shown themselves adept at working with the Department of Labor's registered apprenticeship programs.

The overwhelming majority of community colleges have a ways to go before they can meaningfully contribute to the number of apprenticeships that so many poliu00adticians and analysts argue the nation needs.

In this report we explore how community colu00adleges could play a more active role in growing the number of apprenticeships nationwide, a role that would contribute to resolving the current mismatch between what postsecondary institutions produce and what employers need.

We begin with a brief sumu00admary of the past and current state of apprenticeships and the role apprenticeships play in other countries.

We then turn to the challenges faced by community colleges interested in sponsoring apprenticeship programs and what reforms might help community colleges overcome the internal and external obstau00adcles in their way to expansion.

We conclude with the role private apprenticeship service providers may play as competitors to community colleges interu00adested in apprenticeship programs.

The overwhelming majority of today's college students consider succeeding in the workplace, earning a decent salary, and enjoying a fulfilling career as the main goal of higher education.

2 In recent years, there has been a growing belief that colleges are not adequately preparing students for the jobs and careers needed in the 21st century and that a substantial gap exists between the training and education America's college graduates receive and the skills today's labor market demands.

Of the many options being actively discussed to bridge that divide, apprenticeship programs are attracting widespread bipartisan support.

Apprenu00adticeships are often referred to as the ""Gold standard"" of workforce education.

4 Part of this is because, on average, apprentices tend to outearn nonparticipants, and some apprenticeship programs have been found to yield better results than other training methods, particularly for middle-skills jobs.5 In the past two years of his administration, President Obama made apprenticeships a priority, directing well over $250 million to support apprenticeship programs.

7 Following that executive order, Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta assembled the Apprenticeship Expansion Task Force to develop recommendations to transform American apprenu00adticeships from a system dominated by construction trades and unions to a system that fits the nation's modern, technology-based economy.

In May 2018, the task force released its final report, calling for the development of a ""Separate, streamlined, industry-led"" apprenticeship program, or ""Industry-recognized apprenticeships.""9 A chief component of these industry-recognized apprenticeu00adships would feature nationally portable, industry-recognized credentials.

The task force recommended that quality and accountability requirements remain in place for these apprenticeships and that federal funding criteria be updated to ensure equal treatment of registered apprenticeships and industry-recognized apprenticeships.

That the task force calls for a new and separate apprenticeship program, rather than fixing the current system, might suggest there are structural limitations in the existing apprenticeship program that inhibit it from modernizing.

Clearly, apprenticeships are attracting a great deal of attention at the federal and state levels, but they represent only a sideshow compared to the number of other postsecondary credentials awarded each year.

In 2015 there were 23,578 persons who completed a civilian apprenticeship program.

The number of certificates awarded is up 35 percent over the previous 10 years, while the number of apprenticeship completers has remained stagnant over the same time period.

10 Of the ceru00adtificates awarded, research suggests that many prou00adgrams in technical fields can lead to high earnings, but other certificate programs do not increase averu00adage earnings.

With students continuing to flock to technical training programs through associate degrees and certificates, should community colleges add apprenticeships to that mix as the current adminu00adistration has suggested?13.

Most of the career-oriented credentials are awarded by public two-year community colleges, making them central to America's career and techniu00adcal education system.

14 Not surprisingly, community colleges have officially welcomed the administration's call for apprenticeship programs, and some have shown themselves adept at working with the registered apprenticeu00adship programs that are administered through the Department of Labor.

15 But given how small the number of apprenticeships awarded each year is compared to the number of certificates and degrees they grant, comu00admunity colleges, in spite of their recently expressed willingness, clearly have a ways to go before they can meaningfully contribute to the expanded number of apprenticeships that so many politicians and analysts argue the nation needs.

In this report we explore how community colleges might play a more active role in growing the number of apprenticeships nationwide, a role that would conu00adtribute to resolving the current mismatch between what postsecondary institutions produce and what employers need.

We begin our analysis with a brief summary of the past and current state of apprenticeu00adships because, despite the hype, so little is commonly known about them.

Afterward we discuss the condiu00adtions under which community colleges could play a larger role in their expansion.

As the National Center for Education Statistics publication makes clear, public community colleges are the nation's main producers of certificates and associate degrees, awarding about two-thirds of certificates and 80 percent of associate degrees.

Consider President Trump's call for more vocational training in his 2018 State of the Union message and his subsequent comment about renaming community colleges vocational schools, as noted in Ashley A. Smith, ""Less Community, More Vocational,"" Inside Higher Ed, February 2, 2018, www.

Walter Bumphus, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, has ""Agreed to work with the Labor Department on a plan for scaling up apprenticeship programs.""

Several occupations across multiple in-demand sectors such as information technology and advanced manufacturing were also approved, including the first occupation in hospitality with MGM Resorts International.

Faced with a growing shortage of skilled workers, these apprenticeship opportunities will empower Nevada's employers to cultivate future talent and assist individuals seeking career and economic mobility.

The Governor's Office of Workforce Innovation, also known as OWINN, has successfully scaled and expanded registered apprenticeships over the past year as an innovative strategy to reduce the state's skills gap.

""The addition of this new apprenticeship program and these new occupations in high-demand industries add further momentum in the ongoing efforts to develop and retain a diverse and skilled workforce in Nevada that is consistent with Governor Sandoval's bold workforce vision"" said Manny Lamarre, Executive Director of OWINN.

672,Staff,5/18/2018 10:00,"Southern Maine Community College, in partnership with Maine Medical Partners and Southern Maine Health Care, is launching a new medical assisting apprenticeship program.

Students will learn medical assisting skills in the classroom and apply them on the job while employed by Maine Medical Partners and the hospital.

Southern Maine Health Care and Maine Medical Partners are members of MaineHealth, the state's largest health care organization.

Through the apprenticeship, 10 participants will work with medical assistants for 20 hours a week at Maine Medical Partners offices in the Portland area and at Southern Maine Health Care in Biddeford.

At the same time, they will receive blended classroom and online instruction from SMCC medical assisting instructors to be applied toward an SMCC certificate in medical assisting.

The credits earned can also be applied toward an associate degree in medical assisting.

""Medical assistants are in high demand in the workforce,"" said SMCC President Ron Cantor.

""The aging baby boomer population will continue to increase demand for preventive medical services, requiring doctors to hire more medical assistants. Apprenticeships are effective tools for learning, career development and developing expertise in a given field.""

Medical assistants take vital signs, blood pressure and pulses of patients, review their medication and prepare them for examination.

They also update patient medical records, fill out insurance forms and handle correspondence and billing.

""Many medical conditions are now treated on an outpatient basis rather than in a hospital setting, so outpatient care is much more complex,"" said Louise Beaulieu, clinical director of practice operations at Southern Maine Health Care.

""This opportunity for students to have a whole year of hands-on experience is an optimum way for them to learn. It will not only help fill the void we have in southern Maine for skilled staff, but prepare the students extremely well. This is a very exciting opportunity.""

Employment of medical assistants was projected to grow 29 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the 7.4 percent growth for all occupations, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The new apprenticeship program began May 15 and takes a little over a year.

Upon completion, participants will take a national accreditation exam to become certified medical assistants.

Funding is provided through the Maine Quality Centers.

The Maine Quality Centers is part of the Maine Community College System and provides customized workforce training grants to Maine employers, with training delivered through SMCC and Maine's other community colleges."
678,Mark Cavitt mcavitt@digitalfirstmedia.com; @MarkCavitt on Twitter,5/20/2018 7:00,"That inspired her to get involved in the skilled trades.

Over the course of the two-year program, she will learn skills while working in the classroom, in the school's lab, which includes building a house, and on-the-job with Auch Construction that she hopes will lead to a successful career in a field yearning for more talent.

While Johnson is learning skills and a trade, she's also helping address a talent shortage that's expected to grow in coming years.

After her time in Perry, she was sent to work with a contractor - Pontiac-based Auch Construction.

For Johnson, an apprenticeship program focused on skilled trades,means she will gain valuable hands-on experience and knowledge while helping employers fill a need.

Vince DeLeonardis, president and CEO of Auch Construction, said it's important in a talent-shortage market to reach out into the schools and let parents and students know about the opportunities to work in skilled trades.

""Now, I think we're doing a better job of letting these kids know about these great programs where students are gaining practical knowledge and getting prepared for college and beyond.""

He said Carlea's passion for the skilled trades is obvious and that there needs to be more young people like her engaged in the workforce.

""She has an excellent work ethic and the ability to navigate a job site,"" said DeLeonardis.

""That's what we are looking for. For her, there are a lot of opportunities to go far, including with us. This apprenticeship will expose her to what the laborers do and the other related trades as well.""

Doug Smith, director of workforce development at Oakland Community College, said it's the community college working in collaboration with school systems that's at the heart of reducing the skills gap.

He said it's important that people enter the workforce with some basic skills, not just technical talent.

According to Oakland County's three-year economic forecast, 42,000 jobs will be added over the next three years, which means employers will be under more pressure to fill those added positions and find the right talent.

Smith said one challenge getting people back into the workforce is the time they have been sidelined without a job.

""We have to go after this group by working with employers and using job training and apprenticeship programs to develop that talent.""

Jack Van Tiem, vice president for Kelly Services-Metro Detroit region, said it's critical that the county and others continue to foster partnerships that encourage various skills.

""Also, explore the undersourced, under-leveraged groups of potential workers, such as those with physical and mental impairments, victims of abuse, refugees, and technical training programs for those incarcerated, and felony-friendly employer environments.""

Smith said it's important to engage younger individuals because fewer are working during high school and need training and hands-on experience before getting a job.

He said employers are more willing to bring alternative groups into skilled trades because there is a smaller talent pool, including teens with apprenticeships and job training experience.

""Employers are also trying to tackle this skills gap by attempting to hang onto their employees longer than in years past,' said Smith.""When you hit 4 percent unemployment, or just under in Oakland County, there is a large part of the population that has been disengaged from the workforce and they're just not participating.

Employers want colleges and trade schools, apprenticeship programs and internships to concentrate on skilled trades such as welding, which is in extremely high demand, according to Smith.

Apprenticeships are tougher to develop than internships because it's up to employers to create a U.S. labor department-approved program.

""We work with mostly larger companies,"" said Smith.

""The highest demand we get right now are for students with experience working with programmable logistical controllers, which control manufacturing processes and systems.

At the state level, research is being done to determine real-time labor demand in industries that advertise the most jobs.

Jason Palmer, director of the state's labor market information and strategic initiatives, said 31 percent of March job openings required a high school diploma or some college, particularly for computer or mathematics jobs.

""The unemployed are experiencing barriers that may need new job skills or training,"" he said.

""When you're getting fewer and fewer people applying for jobs, employers are beginning to look at these alternative populations.

Jobs available for youth are different and more high-skilled.

Oakland County Michigan Works!, the county's workforce development arm, is also working to develop talent employers need but can't find.

It publishes an apprenticeship guide and a report of the most in-demand skills that employers are seeking.

Jennifer Llewellyn, the county's workforce development manager, said many companies are looking for teens to fill positions because the competition for talent is so fierce.

""As demand for talent increases, companies expand their willingness to train and reach out to populations they may not have considered previously, including teens, seniors, stay-at-home moms, and individuals with disabilities.

She added that companies are aware that demand for talent is real and are more proactive with their talent pipeline, which includes engaging high schools, technical schools and community colleges to reach and engage young talent.

To help develop the talent pipeline, the state has provided $2 million to 86 Oakland County companies to train individuals in high-demand sectors.

""Companies are having a very difficult time finding talent because the jobs that are open don't match up with those individuals that are looking for employment,"" said Llewellyn.

She said although nearly every occupation could have apprentices, the county's primary focus is creating apprenticeships in advanced manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and construction.

In March, Oakland County's unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, fourth lowest among the state's 83 counties.

According to Dan Riley, researcher with the Oakland County Department of Economic Development, the share of workers in industrial and construction skilled trades occupations that are under the age of 35 has risen between 2009 and 2017.

""We cannot tell if the job growth at that lower end of the age range could have actually been higher if there was a greater supply of labor."

The state is expected to reach near 100,000 apprenticeships by 2020.  California has invested $15 million per year for the last three years through its Apprenticeship Initiative program to create new opportunities in transportation and logistics, healthcare, IT and advanced manufacturing.

692,Catherine Gewertz,5/22/2018 12:05,"President Trump's task force on apprenticeship has issued its final report. But even though the president said he wants to see apprenticeship opportunities in every U.S. high school, the report makes no mention of how that might happen.  After only five meetings, the 20-member task force quietly released its recommendations on May 10, accompanied by a short press release, and no press conference. That low-profile approach is in marked contrast to the bells-and-whistles event at the White House in June 2017, featuring a smiling Trump signing an executive order calling for a major expansion of apprenticeships.  The task force's charge was to recommend ways to create a new channel for approval of what Trump calls ""earn as you learn"" programs. That channel would be separate and distinct from the Department of Labor's longstanding registered apprenticeship program.

In the new ""Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship programs,"" or IRAPs, employers would partner with third-party training organizations (which could include community colleges) to develop the apprenticeship programs, and have them certified by overseers such as industry associations.  But despite Trump's call for apprenticeships in ""every high school in America,"" the phrase ""high school"" appears only seven times in the final report, and they're all in an introductory section that recaps the past and current landscape of apprenticeship.

696,Tim Krohntkrohn@mankatofreepress.com,5/23/2018 7:00,"MANKATO - Apprenticeships - particularly in the construction trades - have been around for many decades.

Now the state, businesses and trade unions are trying to beef up training and expand apprenticeships to sectors that haven't traditionally used them.

John Aiken, director of Apprenticeship Minnesota at the Department of Labor and Industry, said the agency has worked with apprentice programs in building and construction trades since the late 1930s.

""We're trying to expand it to more industries. We're looking at advanced manufacturing, agribusiness, IT, health care, transportation. All these are looking for that next generation of talent and how they're going to replace all the talent from retiring baby boomers,"" Aiken said.

With the help of a federal grant, the state is enrolling more businesses as approved apprenticeship sites and paying for training.

""The grant award is based on the number of people you will register as apprentices. It's $5,000 per apprentice for their training costs. They can't use the grant to pay for wages for the employee,"" Aiken said.

Stacey Karels, Mankato business agent and president of the Mankato Area Building and Construction Trades Council, said the local trade groups have long had apprentice programs and now they are working with high schools in hopes up beefing up industrial arts classes, many of which were trimmed over the years.

That, he said, would prepare students who want to go into the trades and reduce the amount of on-the-job training.

""We're working with the schools and the teachers who deal with shop classes and things.""

The national building trades union has been working with high schools to implement the Multi-Craft Core Curriculum, or MC3, providing students a pathway for careers in the trades.

Part of the effort is to help train the industrial arts teachers in area high schools.

""The state requires teachers to have certain number of years working in a trade to teach it,"" Karels said.

Many teachers today didn't start out in trades.

The Trades Council brings in a nationally recognized trainer for a two-day ""Train the trainer"" workshop for teachers.

The recognized training helps fulfill the teachers' licensing needs.

Karels said all the funding for the program comes from private membership fees, not public dollars.

""It doesn't cost the schools anything because we provide grants.""

The local trades also have robust apprenticeship programs, with employees learning on the job and getting classroom training, either locally or in the Twin Cities.

Karels said most of the apprenticeships are three- to four-year programs.

""We call it earn while you learn."" As apprentices hit different numbers of training hours, their pay rises.

Beyond job skills, the apprenticeships focus on safety training.

Aiken said they hope to bring the kind of apprenticeship programs the trades have long had to other industries desperate for workers.

""We register apprentice programs here. We work with employers and listen to them about their recruiting, retraining and retaining needs. We've seen great success in this model.""

He said businesses using apprentice programs also have a higher retention rate.

""When they invest in them in that way, these folks tend to want to stay.""

Aiken said that once a business or public entity is registered with the state's apprentice program, they can get the funding for training apprentices.

He said the business can choose who they want to provide the training.

""The employer is in the driver's seat. They're deciding who they want to use as an instruction provider, whatever fits what they're trying to do."""
700,Steven Meyers,5/23/2018 10:11,"The U.S. economy is the best shape since the turn of the 21st century. Unemployment has reached a rare low of 3.9 percent, wages are rising, and the international consensus is that the U.S. market is one of reliability and confidence. Indeed, there has never been a better time to invest in the United States and its workers.  And yet, millions of American workers are at risk of being left behind in the global 21st century economy. Adapting and flourishing in the new economy will require innovative approaches to job training, education, and economic development.

Workforce development is not only a necessity. It also falls at the intersection of multiple government focuses, from collaborating with countries like Switzerland?where apprenticeships are well-established and common?to programs designed to reduce recidivism, such as the Department of Justice?s UNICOR program. Using an all-encompassing strategy, the Trump Administration is focused on creating good-paying jobs for millions of Americans.  This is why President Trump issued an executive order calling for a multi-department effort to expand apprenticeships in the United States. Specifically, the order created the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, a Department of Labor-led body of industry leaders and government officials. On May 10, 2018, the Task Force presented its findings to the President, recommending an increase in ?work-and-learn models,? reforms to the funding process, an awareness campaign, and an expansion of apprenticeships in new industries.

Next month, workforce development will be a central focus of the 2018 SelectUSA Investment Summit, the top foreign direct investment event in the United States.

The official announcement of the initiative, called the Michigan Apprenticeships Experience Sooner campaign, was made Wednesday at the West Bay Beach, a Holiday Inn Resort during the three-day Spring 2018 Conference of the Michigan Educators Apprenticeship & Training Association.

The Apprenticeship in a Day program is intended to allow companies to set up an apprenticeship program quickly and painlessly, said Roger Curtis of the Michigan Career Pathways Alliance.

A common misconception among business managers is that it is complicated to set up an apprenticeship program, said Janene Erne, president of the MEATA. ""There's still a huge disconnect in Michigan,"" she said, between the need for and understanding of apprenticeships.

""The demand for apprenticeships is expanding rapidly.""

A total of 16 paid apprentice positions could be available this summer as a result of the eight programs.

The initiative is part of the Michigan Apprenticeships Experience Sooner campaign, the product of an alliance among the Michigan Talent Investment Agency, the Advance Michigan Center for Apprenticeship Innovation, The Talent and Economic Development Department of Michigan, the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship, the Michigan Works! Association and MEATA. The Michigan Talent Investment Agency's recently released research report revealed that only 13 percent of high school students consider apprenticeships a good postsecondary career option, and only 21 percent of parents think they are good option.

The report suggested that about 55 percent of parents and 14- to 30-year-olds do not understand apprenticeships.

""We need to help these parents understand more about apprenticeships,"" said Curtis.

""About 80 percent of high schoolers say they listen to their parents on career matters.""

The Apprenticeship in a Day event was formed to help show that creating a program is easy, and to gather all the partners that an employer needs to create an apprenticeship program together in one place, Erne said.

Experience Sooner events will be repeated this summer in cities including Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo and Lansing.

Many apprenticeships offer paid employment from day one and therefore don't involve student debt, according to www."
712,David D. Haynes,5/24/2018 12:13,"Jacobo Hernandez has a dream: Build a company to solve a persistent problem in the music business - how to make sure you get credit for your work.

He's moving up the skills ladder by refining his coding skills through a program at UMOS, a south side community nonprofit.

TechHire, which helped make possible the program Hernandez is enrolled in, is in its second year in the Milwaukee area.

Like counterparts operated by Employ Milwaukee and Waukesha-Ozaukee-Washington Workforce Development Inc., the UMOS program helps people like Hernandez get skills to start them on a career path.

TechHire is part of an emerging school of thought that places more emphasis on a person's skills than on their degrees or other credentials.

Among the biggest proponents is Skillful, which incubated the idea in Colorado over the past two years and is expanding to other states including Wisconsin.

Degrees still matter - and should - but when they become virtually a generic requirement, it leaves some people on the sidelines who could have the skill set to be in the game.

By focusing on skills and de-emphasizing four-year degrees in jobs that don't actually need them, both potential workers and employers have more options.

After graduating from Greendale High School, Hernandez got an associate's degree in medical technology and found work, but he wasn't happy with his path.

""I've been studying web development independently for a couple of years,"" he said, ""And this has really helped me master my skills.""

Why are employers focusing more on skills? As labor markets tighten, employers are looking for every good candidate they can find, particularly in certain technical fields.

As a Harvard Business School report noted last year, ""Degree inflation"" - demanding a four-year degree for jobs that previously hadn't required one - had been ""Making the U.S. labor market more inefficient"" because perfectly capable people were overlooked or didn't bother to apply.

Katy Hamilton, a director at the Markle Foundation, a founding partner of Skillful, which is evangelizing for a skills-based labor market, said ""Using a degree as a proxy is screening out capable candidates.""

One example from Wisconsin: Sales representatives in wholesale and manufacturing were the fourth-most in-demand job, by number of job postings, she said.

Sixty-nine percent of those postings required a bachelor's degree, but only 46% of current sales reps have a bachelor's now.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is pushing to recognize a range of paths to becoming a ""Qualified worker."" As The Atlantic reported, she told members of the White House Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion last November, ""We need to stop forcing kids into believing a traditional four-year degree is the only pathway to success. We need to start treating students as individuals not boxing them in.""

UMOS has trained about 100 people so far in areas such as web development, medical help desk and Microsoft certifications.

The WOW group has trained 100 people since January 2017, with a focus on information technology, health care and manufacturing.

Employ Milwaukee has trained about 120 people so far in basic tech skills, some of whom got technical jobs in retail while others are getting further training.

What is Skillful?Skillful is a collaboration launched in March 2016 between the New York-based Markle Foundation and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper that aims to transform the U.S. labor market to a skills-based model, allowing workers to show they have the skills to do a job or, if they don't, to figure out how to go get them.

""Skillful is trying to shift to a labor market that is based on skills where individuals are able to demonstrate their ability to do a job more transparently and employers are able to deepen their potential talent pools to identify candidates,"" Hamilton said.

A persistent problem is that employers sometimes have traditional views about hiring.

Job descriptions are filled with unnecessary requirements, which makes for a shallower talent pool.

The state network of both Republican and Democratic governors aims to share best practices in workforce development and find new pathways to good jobs for people without college degrees.

In Colorado, that has meant a constant emphasis on skills and sharing up-to-date information on jobs and the skills they require.

Along with the governor's office, Skillful has created a leadership program for a small group of ""Superstar coaches,"" who will then help train others.

Why should I care about a skills-based approach?It's always good to assess your raw skills or work with a counselor who can help you do that.

If you're falling short - or if a year from now you aren't satisfied with your first job or don't have a job - short-term skills-based training can help fill gaps.

That means nearly everyone will need to pay attention to their skill sets, making lifelong learning a necessity.

What about people without four-year degrees?About two-thirds of Americans don't have a four-year degree.

Short-term training can help them reskill quickly, especially for so-called middle-skill jobs, and can get them launched on a path to further training.

Buford, who is leaving in late June to run a workforce agency in Pittsburgh, said Employ Milwaukee is working with MPS and MATC to help students get short-term training that can either lead to jobs immediately or more schooling - or both.

You mentioned middle-skill jobs? What's that?That's a job that may need some training beyond high school but not a four-year degree.

What's the outlook for middle-skill jobs?Demand remains strong for these kinds of jobs, according to the National Skills Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. The group predicts that roughly half of job openings in Wisconsin will be middle-skill jobs over the next few years.

As a Harvard study noted, there long has been a mismatch between the jobs that are open and the qualified people available to fill those jobs.

Foxconn, which is building a mega-factory in Racine County to make flat-panel displays, will likely need hundreds of workers who have a high school diploma and entry-level skills along with workers who have a higher skill set.

What else is happening in Wisconsin to train workers?Here are a few highlights: Over the last four years, the administration of Gov. Scott Walker has allocated more than $200 million for workforce development and is budgeting another $140 million in the current budget, according to John Dipko, spokesman for the state Department of Workforce Development.

In the 2017-'18 school year, the state is budgeting $3.9 million for its Youth Apprenticeship program, which will expose about 4,000 high school students to career paths in their own communities.

Last year, the Wisconsin Registered Apprenticeship program had about 11,000 apprentices working at more than 2,000 businesses, Dipko noted.

The state's Wisconsin Fast Forward grant program has awarded $20 million so far to support 200 worker training projects."

718,Staff,5/25/2018 6:00,"There's a misconception that the only way to make a decent living is to earn a college degree.

If you can offer a service that most people can't do on their own - repairing and maintaining equipment and appliances, fixing cars or wiring a home - you could stand to make a nice living.

So rather than going into debt for your education, you're actually earning money.

Here are some tips on getting started in a skilled trade career.

Pick your trade The great thing about trade careers is that they often correspond with your hobbies.

Do you like fixing cars or creating elaborate meals? Consider a career as an auto mechanic or chef.

Do you love gardening or working with wood? Perhaps a career as a horticulturist or cabinetmaker will suit you.

After you've narrowed down your choices to three or four, learn more about them by talking to people in the field and researching job opportunities, pay and long-term possibilities for growth.

Many skilled trade jobs are more mentally demanding than physically demanding.

Stamina, dexterity and good problem-solving skills are usually more useful than brute strength.

If you're someone who prefers being creative and active or working with your hands to sitting at a desk, the skilled trades could be an ideal choice for you.

Become an apprentice The next step is finding an employer who's interested in hiring and training you.

You can find potential contacts through trade unions, professional associations or training institutions, as well as local employment offices, programs and agencies.

Operated by the private and public sectors, registered apprenticeship programs combine on-the-job training with theoretical and practical classroom instruction.

Sponsors include employers, employer associations and joint labor/management organizations.

Program sponsors pay most of the training costs while simultaneously increasing wages as your skill levels increase.

These standards-based programs generally range from one to six years depending on the needs of the program sponsor.

A great resource is the U.S. Department of Labor's Registered Aprenticeship program.

ApprenticeshipUSA offers opportunities to earn a salary while learning the skills necessary to succeed in high-demand careers.

Becoming certified Career-training program participants receive national industry certification upon graduation.

This certification is applicable anywhere in the United States.

CareerWise, a statewide public-private partnership founded by entrepreneur Noel Ginsburg and Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2016 and implemented in 2017, is based on the Swiss youth apprenticeship system.

High school juniors and seniors are eligible for three-year apprenticeships in fields ranging from financial services to manufacturing.

Students earn $25,000 to $30,000 during their apprenticeship while splitting their time between work and school.

Students who participate earn a nationally recognized industry certification and approximately one year's worth of college credit.

Matt Diers, executive director of high schools for School District 51, praised the families, businesses and teachers who make the program possible.

""Four years ago, our goal was to bring CTE programming under the umbrella of District 51,"" Diers said.

""I'm so impressed with the breadth and depth of programming we have now.""

Linda Spencer, Grand Junction's CareerWise program director, attributed much of the program's success to its partnerships with the Grand Junction Area Chamber of Commerce, District 51, Western Colorado Community College, Colorado Mesa University and the Mesa County Workforce Center.

""The fact that our community was one of the first in the state outside of Denver to be part of this program says a lot about the strength of these partnerships,"" Spencer said.

David McGee, vice president of operations at ProStar Geocorp and Jessop's direct supervisor, encourages other employers to participate in the program.

""I talk to a lot of people who are worried they're going to get a stereotypical millennial that just sits there on their phone,"" McGee said.

""That's not been my experience. It's an opportunity to have an apprentice with new insights who works hard. It's a very beneficial partnership.""

Grand Junction Fire Department spokeswoman Ellis Thompson-Ellis, who sponsored an apprentice this year, agrees.

""As an employer, this is an invaluable resource. I'm not sure what we will do without her,"" Thompson-Ellis said, speaking of her apprentice.

The program, heading into its second year, is quickly growing.

In Grand Junction, five new businesses have signed up, and six new apprentices have been hired.

The CareerWise marketplace, where students apply for apprenticeships, will reopen next fall."
728,Steve Carmody,5/27/2018 17:35,"A new survey shows most Michigan high school students are not aware of a potential option after graduation.

A Michigan Talent Investment Agency survey found only 13% of high school students consider apprenticeships a good postsecondary career option.

Roger Curtis is the director of Talent and Economic Development for the state of Michigan.

He says, even among students who were aware of apprenticeship programs, most only associated them with construction jobs.

""There was incredibly little awareness that there are actually apprenticeships in finance, health care, IT-computer science, agriculture and many other fields."" he said.

""We have our work cut out for us.""

The survey found only 21% of parents think apprenticeships are good option for their children.

""We've just been so adamant to tell our kids, 'The only pathway for you is the four-year pathway,'"" says Curtis.

""We've ignored these other pathways and opportunities, great opportunities. I mean careers where you could start at $60-$70,000.""

Michigan has nearly 16,000 active apprentices who are earning while learning, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Curtis says apprenticeship programs can help solve labor shortages in some job fields in Michigan.

John Hindman, director of learning and performance improvement at Tooling U-SME, recently hosted a webinar to discuss how apprenticeship programs can help companies develop and retain a skilled workforce.  Traditional machinist apprenticeship programs have always meant learning while on the job. John Hindman, director of learning and performance improvement at Tooling U-SME, says apprenticeships have been around since at least the 1600s, when they were a form of indentured servitude. Today, he says, there are a half-million registered apprentices in the U.S. Unlike apprentices of old, though, modern apprentices often combine on-the-job learning with classroom and independent study.

Hindman discussed apprenticeships during a webinar from Tooling U-SME and MSC?s Better MRO, ?21st Century Apprenticeship: Building Employee Pipelines, Engagement and Retention through Registered Apprenticeship Programs.?  ?Today?s apprenticeship programs act as an earn-and-learn model, where current employees typically spend normal workdays learning their craft at the workplace and then take educational curriculum during off-work hours,? says Hindman. ?This allows for apprentices to take the knowledge they are learning and apply it to the job through a structured on-the-job learning experience.?"

745,Liz Young,5/30/2018 6:00,"New York will invest $3 million this year for businesses to partner on apprenticeships with the State University of New York system and the state Department of Labor.

The money will go toward creating up to 2,000 training positions in advanced manufacturing and health care in the next four to six years, the governor's office announced Tuesday.

The positions will include registered apprenticeships, which combine education with on-the-job training, and pre-apprenticeships, which are short-term programs to prepare people who are interested in the field but don't yet have the background to get hired.

The total state investment over three years will be $9 million, said Johanna Duncan-Poitier, SUNY's senior vice chancellor of community colleges and the education pipeline.

SUNY will spend money on marketing the apprenticeships to employers and potential applicants, as well as putting on industry roundtables to hear from employers, among other uses.

With the low unemployment rate, employers are struggling to find skilled workers to fill available jobs.

Apprenticeships are one way to address that need, Duncan-Poitier said.

Schenectady County Community College in Schenectady will lead the health care apprenticeships program, as Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica takes the lead on advanced manufacturing.

Mohawk Valley has existing apprenticeships with manufacturers in electrical and mechanical fields.

About a dozen students per semester are enrolled in those, said Franca Armstrong, associate vice president of workforce development at MVCC. ""It does help to build the workforce, and at the same time, it helps employers to keep their employees,"" Armstrong said.

""We're really hoping that this is going to get other companies interested and moving in that direction.""

Revere Copper Products, a manufacturer in Rome, New York, works with MVCC on its apprenticeship program.

Currently, eight apprentices are working at Revere in three fields: electrical, mechanical and machinists.

Mike Choquette, Revere's quality, training and ISO administrator, said the apprentices, who are in the program for four years, are expensive but the program pays off.

""When we bring a person on to be an apprentice, man or woman, we're going to pay them a salary, we're going to give them their benefits, we're going to give them a 401(k),"" Choquette said.

Choquette said this state investment will help offset some of the costs of the MVCC training.

Of the apprentices Choquette has worked with, 81 percent in the mechanical field stayed at Revere and all of the machinists have stayed.

Revere Copper Products employs more than 300 people making copper products that will be used by other manufacturers.

When workers retire, the manufacturer has to evaluate whether to hire a skilled tradesperson or an apprentice.

Choquette said the company prefers to hire the latter.

""We like to go with skilled apprentices because skilled trades are so hard to find, to find someone whose familiar with our machinery,"" Choquette said.

The health care apprenticeships through SCCC will include three titles: Community health care worker, medical hospital coder and direct support professional.

Employers from hospitals to doctors' offices to community development organizations are interested, said Denise Zieske, vice president for workforce development and community education at SCCC. She said the school has heard from community colleges west and south of SCCC who may participate in the program.

""They're realizing there's an employment need within their community and hoping this might be a way to fill that void,"" Zieske said.

In the future, apprenticeships may be added in areas like information technology and cybersecurity; business services and insurance; logistics and transportation; and hospitality, said Jennifer Miller, director of community college support at SUNY.."
747,Patricia Moran,5/30/2018 9:00,"Today, the son of a long-time neighbor stopped by. I haven?t seen him since he graduated from high school a few years ago, and I was surprised and delighted that he came over. I am sure his parents encouraged him to speak with me.  As I weeded my rock garden, he proceeded to tell me all about his ?welding apprenticeship.? I asked him where he was working and he told me that he wasn?t working anywhere. So I had to break the news that he wasn?t an apprentice. Maybe he was a pre-apprentice taking the courses that would enable him to become an apprentice, but without employment, he is not an apprentice.

Apprenticeship involves two things: a job and additional schooling.  An apprentice is someone who is on the job learning the skills by a master craftsman who is considered an expert in the field. Apprentices also take classes that further the knowledge and skills they are practicing every day.  So this young man was enrolled in a local school to learn the trade of welding. I am sure the word ?apprentice? came into play and he jumped to the conclusion that he was an apprentice. I hope was able to clarify the situation. I did encourage him to complete his welding training and prepare for the next step of employment."

759,Staff,1/10/2017 7:36 AM,"Focus: Hope plans to permanently lay off 120 employees in March, according to a notice filed with the state of Michigan.

The Detroit-based human service and workforce training nonprofit disclosed the layoffs in a WARN filing dated Jan. 5 that was posted on the state website Monday.

The layoffs, set to take place March 5, will impact 110 general assemblers and 10 Hi-Lo drivers, according to the notice.

The layoffs come just five months after Jason Lee, former executive director of the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, succeeded retiring CEO William Jones Jr. who'd held the position since 2009.

Despite a long list of corporate supporters including the region's top automakers and suppliers, the iconic Focus: Hope, established following the 1967 riots in Detroit, has struggled financially the past couple of years in the wake of lost federal, state and local funding for workforce training.

Focus: Hope's senior meal and early-childhood center programs have designated federal funding dedicated to support them.

Its workforce development programs have not had sustained funding since 2011 when federal earmarks for its programs were cut.

The program has relied on piecing together funding from the state, corporations and donors.

In October 2015, Crain's reported Focus: Hope had suspended new enrollment in its workforce training programs until it could secure funding for them, following 10-percent pay cuts for about 125 employees and reduced work weeks that had begun during the summer of that year.

The cuts followed the expiration or nonrenewal of nearly $3.2 million total in workforce training and related grants from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and Detroit Employment Solutions Corp. The MEDC renewal grant was awarded to other nonprofit contractees for 2016 that the MEDC said were better suited to fulfill them.

The nonprofit was awarded a $3 million grant by the U.S. Department of Labor as part of the American Apprenticeship Grants in September 2015 to help train people for higher-wage and higher-skill jobs as CNC operators, machinists and information technology professionals.

It had also received at least $4.36 million in cash donations, pledges and equipment from corporate funders by November 2015.

It's unclear if any of the contracts or funding extended into 2017.

Focus: Hope reported $24.3 million in total revenue for fiscal 2015, the year of its most recent tax filing, down from $29.3 million the year before.

It reported a $2.9 million loss for 2015, with $4.4 million in net assets/fund balances as it headed into 2016."

Aldermere Farm and Erickson Fields ? attract individuals pursuing careers in agriculture. The lessons they learn go beyond the logistics of farm operations. During their time at the farms, apprentices engage with the community through educational agricultural programs, which teach about the local food system?food production, processing, distribution, consumption and waste management? through the lens of environmental conservation and community well-being. This year MCHT will once again offer paid apprenticeships at Aldermere Farm and Erickson Fields. Each apprenticeship will be up to 9-months starting in March and will include a monthly stipend, benefits, shared housing, training and supervision.

At Aldermere Farm apprentices gain experience managing all facets of a beef farm?s operations, including the logistics of hay and baleage production and rotational grazing, and developing annual plans to manage a herd?s health, reproduction and nutrition. Apprentices also help lead ag programs for youth, like the Aldermere Achievers 4-H Club and the Farm Hands after-school program.

771,Staff,1/12/2018 1:59 PM,"Why don't more young Americans go for apprenticeships as opposed to enrolling in college? That question becomes more and more important as a) huge numbers of college ""Educated"" students struggle to repay their student loans, b) many college grads end up working in entry-level jobs they could have gotten right out of high school, and c) employers are struggling to find capable workers for many skilled trades jobs that pay well.

In today's Martin Center article, Anthony Hennen looks into that question.

It isn't an ideological issue, Hennen writes: ""Both the political left and right favor apprenticeships as a way to educate and train America's youth for future success while also meeting the demands of the economy.""

Most of us seem to have accepted the notion that it's far better to have a college degree to your name than not.

It's something of a stigma to admit that you don't have college credentials.

So do high-school guidance counselors - even students who perform poorly are encouraged to try for college instead of looking for apprenticeships or vocational training.

For people who don't care about the stigma, apprenticeships have a lot of offer in comparison with college.

Hennen writes, ""For many young people, apprenticeships should be especially attractive because they offer an immediate paycheck for work and also teach skills in both hands-on and classroom settings. The average apprenticeship period tends to be about four years, according to Department of Labor statistics, and workers usually become full employees upon program completion."" That looks much better than four or more years to get a BA, then perhaps settling for a mundane job.

To that, I'll add this point: For a great many young people, education is boring.

They don't like sitting in classes, reading books, or writing papers.

They look for courses that are somewhat fun and easy, and are happy when classes are called off.

Most people would be happier learning and then doing something useful, a point that Bryan Caplan stresses in his new book The Case Against Education, which I will review for the Martin Center soon.

Apprenticeships are growing, and probably will grow faster as more Americans realize that having a BA is not all it has been cracked up to be.

With more apprentices ignoring the possible stigma, that could result in workers finding jobs that match their skills and a reduction in student debt - for students and for the taxpayers who subsidize the loans.

It's important to treat apprenticeships as one option of many for education and economic training with its own costs and benefits - much like a college degree."

808,By Denise Allabaugh,1/21/2018 5:44 AM,"NANTICOKE - Since he was young, Wilkes-Barre resident Mark Gatusky wanted to be an electrician.

Both his grandfathers, his father and uncles were electricians and part of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 163.

Gatusky, 37, said his family wanted him to try going to college first, however.

He went to the University of Scranton, earned a master's degree in history and subsequently worked in the health insurance business for years.

He often traveled, didn't see his family enough and he said the return on his investment ""Just wasn't there.""

He decided to follow his dream to become an electrician.

Gatusky is in his final year of a five-year electrical apprenticeship where he gets on-the-job paid training as well as education at a training center that opened last year at 41 W. Church St., Nanticoke.

He has done electrical work for projects ranging from a water park to natural gas power plants to the PPL Center, an arena in Allentown.

Pointing out that he earns a higher salary with better benefits as an electrician, Gatusky said, ""I found myself much happier doing this and working with my hands.""

""It's a creative way to make a living. No day is the same,"" he said.

""You could use your mind, be creative and have a living that you could have pride in, not only from a paycheck perspective, but you could look at a building and say, 'You know what? I did that.'"".

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union 163 and Penn-Del-Jersey chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association turned the former St. Stanislaus Catholic School in Nanticoke into a training center for electricians.

Training director John T. Nadolny said there is no cost for a five-year electrical apprenticeship.

Prior to opening the new training center, they rented space from Luzerne County Community College, he said.

Apprentices in the program receive technical training on Monday and Wednesday nights for three hours and occasionally Saturdays from September to April as well on-the-job paid training with contractors.

Their starting pay is about $12 an hour plus benefits for the first 1,000 hours.

Electricians have the potential to earn more than $34 an hour plus benefits for an entire family, he said.

""You earn while you learn and at the end, you get college credits,"" Nadolny said.

""You can go for an associate's degree, a bachelor's degree or a master's degree and get up to 60 credits for this five-year program.""

Over the five years of the program, Nadolny said apprentices receive 8,000 hours of on-the-job training.

""This isn't a job. It's a career,"" he said.

""It's not for everybody. It's hard work. It's very dangerous work. We teach them how to be safe.""

Electricians do outside work and inside work ranging from wiring homes, schools, hospitals, arenas and commercial, industrial and manufacturing facilities to lighting protection.

Nadolny said there is a big demand for electricians.

Good candidates have mechanical knowledge and are dependable, he said.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of electricians is projected to grow 9 percent over the next eight years.

As homes and businesses require more wiring, more electricians will be needed.

Becoming an electrician is a good high-paying alternative for interested applicants who don't want to take on the high debt of college, Nadolny said.

""Unfortunately, many of people who go to college end up with a quarter of a million dollars of debt when they're done and they work at McDonald's,"" he said.

""College isn't for everybody. Maybe some would do better in the trades.""

Mountain Top resident Jillian Henderson, 31, is in her first year of the electrical apprenticeship.

While being an electrician is not a traditional career for women, Henderson said she loves to work with her hands.

""You get to use your hands and your brains. It's the best of both worlds,"" Henderson said.

""My father is a contractor so it runs in the family.""

Wilkes-Barre resident Ernesto Tapia, 27, who also is in his first year of the apprenticeship, said he also loves working with his hands and doing something different every day.

""I can't stay in one spot,"" Tapia said.

""I can't sit inside. I've got to do different things, work inside and outside.""

People can apply for the apprenticeship on the first Monday of each month between 1 and 6 p.m. at 41 W. Church St., Nanticoke.

Applicants must be 18, be a high school graduate or have a GED and receive a satisfactory score on a Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee test and resident in the Local 163 jurisdiction, which is mostly Luzerne County.

IBEW Local 81 has a training center with the same program in South Abington Twp. for Lackawanna County residents."

The program also covers topics that are vital components in a career in manufacturing.

Participants will receive two additional certifications for forklift and flagger.

Christine Jensen, administrator of CareerLink in Luzerne County, said many local employers are recruiting for new employees with particular skills that are becoming harder to find.

The program teaches skills required to be successful in today's work environments, she said.

These skills include work readiness, math for the trades, Occupational Safety Hazard and Health Administration regulations and basic residential construction.

""This knowledge will enable participants to pursue a career in the building trades as well as in the manufacturing industry,"" Ms. Jensen said.

Classes will be held three nights a week, said Cathy Gerard, administrator at CareerLink In Lackawanna County.

Ms. Gerard said she has been reaching out to boys and girls clubs and YMCAs to attract young adults to the program who never had the opportunity to get the skills they need to get into the construction trades.

A self-described product of an apprenticeship himself, Tenbergen knows firsthand about the benefits of enabling on-the-job training opportunities. Within the past three-plus years that he has served as dean, leveraging key community partnerships he spearheaded three other grant applications that have created apprenticeship paths.  ?Now we are probably the only college in the U.S. who has very unique apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs in hospitality, fire science, early childhood development and automotive?to provide qualified workers for their industries,? Tenbergen enthuses.  These programs are now being implemented in partnership with major hospitality employers, Rush Creek and Evergreen lodges and Black Oak Casino and Resort; early education program providers through Amador-Tuolumne Community Action Agency (ATCCA); and local automotive industry operators."
877,Louise Wrege - Hp,1/5/2018 6:36 AM,"ST. JOSEPH - The demand for trained workers is growing in Southwest Michigan, and the Michigan Laborers' Training and Apprenticeship Institute is opening in the Hilltop Center in St. Joseph to help fill that need.

The first class, which starts Monday, is a 30-hour Occupational Safety and Health Administration training course that teaches health and safety awareness to reduce the risk of workplace hazards.

""We specialize in safety training,"" said Jeff ""Wilee"" Smrz, site manager for the new facility.

""We do several different classes, including OSHA, road work safety, flagging, things of that nature that are just safety-oriented classes.""

He said many people are surprised to learn that road construction flaggers have to take a class.

""You don't want the guy standing on the road telling you when to go and when not to go if he doesn't know what he's doing,"" Smrz said.

""Michigan has some very extensive regulations on that. It's not a very long class, but it's still a class to get them to know the proper regulations of how to set the signs on the road, how to do lane closures.""

""You want them to maintain the safety of the public,"" he said.

""You want them to maintain the safety of the crew.""

Smrz said a class on asbestos removal requires 40 hours of class time and 600 hours of apprenticeship.

He said OSHA training is required in many states, but not in Michigan.

He said many contractors want their workers to have the OSHA training anyway.

""In the long run, a more educated construction worker, whether union or nonunion, is a safer construction worker,"" he said.

""A safer construction worker saves the contractor money.""

MLTAI, which is nonprofit, is part of the Laborers' International Union of North America, which has more than 70 training centers throughout the country.

MLTAI has three training centers in Michigan - Iron Mountain, Perry and Wayne.

Smrz said the St. Joseph center is the first one to open since the 1990s.

He said classes are free of charge, even to nonunion members.

He said contractors pay an hourly rate for every hour a union member works to go into the education fund.

Training is offered in commercial, highway and underground construction and in environmental remediation.

""All the oil spills that happened the last few years, a large portion of those were our people cleaning them up,"" he said.

Smrz said their busiest time is January through April.

""We are swamped with members who have worked summer construction ... and they want to improve their skills,"" he said.

""They want to have their up-to-date and make themselves more marketable.""

Benton Harbor resident Arlandar Washington - who serves as the business manager of Laborers' Local Union 355 - said he's been trying to get a training facility on the west side of the state for almost 20 years.

He said having a training center in St. Joseph means people in this area won't have to drive to the Lansing area to get training.

He said the union provides contractors with laborers that are needed to complete jobs.

""Our signatory contractors, when they come into the area, they bring some of their core guys with them,"" Washington said.

""But when they have to expand their crews, they tend to get them from the local jurisdiction that they're working in.""

Washington and Smrz were in agreement that having local skilled people working with contractors is a benefit to everyone.

""It keeps a lot of the local people working and keeps the money in the community,"" Smrz said.

Washington added: ""We want to help the community out. We do have the skills to train workers to be safe on the job and do the job right the first time.""

879,Stuart Price,1/5/2018 8:20 PM,"An area employment organization is making it easy for residents that want to start a career in the new year, or change careers.  You may not know this, but some local industries oftentimes have more openings than they do qualified workers to fill them. Construction is a good example.  But a new program called the Pre-Apprenticeship Career Readiness Program can get someone in that industry in a matter of 12 weeks, and Bubba Evansco says you can't beat the cost.

""You're sitting around the house, you've maybe got your high school diploma or equivalency and that's it, you don't have any other skills right now and you're thinking ?I don't have any money to go to college or money to get into one of these tech centers.? This is a 12 week program that's free, absolutely free that at the end of this program not only do you get a paid internship during the program, but when you leave you'll have your NCRC, your OSHA 10, a forklift certificate you'll be able to go to work making well above minimum wage, in some cases maybe double that,? says Bubba Evansco.  ""We're gonna teach these folks some blueprint reading skills, some math skills, finance skills after they get a job at home, we're gonna teach them some trade construction skills in the classroom, we're gonna give them uh CPR first aid training, anything they need to be successful on the job and get in a job,? says Chris Harper, Crowder College Training & Development.  Some of the training for the 12 week program will take place at the Advanced Training and Technology Center in Joplin.

Jones,1/8/2018  12:00 AM,"In early 2016, Zurich North America teamed up with William Rainey Harper College in Palatine, Ill., to offer an apprenticeship in insurance program and now its first group of employee-students have graduated with a job at the company and an associate degree in business administration. Each graduate also received the Certified Insurance Apprentice designation through the Department of Labor?s ApprenticeshipUSA initiative.  Zurich NA?s parent company, Zurich Insurance Group, has long had an apprenticeship program in Switzerland, where the group is headquartered. In 2014, 94 percent of those who completed the three-year program in that country stayed on as Zurich employees, the company said.  But there were a lot of unknowns three years ago when the company was designing its curriculum for the United States. For one thing, while collaborative apprenticeship programs between colleges and industry are not unknown in the U.S., most are in manufacturing and trade industries. Harper College had an apprenticeship program in manufacturing in place, but one serving the financial services/insurance sector was a first for the institution.

With an 80 percent graduation rate in the first cohort, the company considers the inaugural class a success. According to Al Crook, head of HR Business Partners for Chicago-based ZurichNA, the apprenticeship participants are not the only ones who received an education throughout the implementation and completion of this new program. He says Zurich is eager to share its experience with other companies that are interested in what apprenticeship programs have to offer.  Crook described the program as an ?earn-and-learn model. The apprentices are in the Zurich offices for three days of the week and they go to Harper College for two days of the week.?"

In 2017 more than 150 local businesses partnered with the Dane County School Consortium to give Juniors and Seniors the chance to try their hand at an occupation through paid internships as a Youth Apprentice.  Students are required to take related courses that complement their internship and are held to a high standard of excellence.

Josh Fassl, Director of the Dane County School Consortium, said the experience benefits both the student and the mentor.  ?It?s a win-win. The students get to experience parts of an occupation that they are interested in before graduating and going to college,? Fassl said. ?They gain critical knowledge and then can determine if they want to stay in the field or if it wasn?t what they expected. For the employers, it gives them a chance to partner with and mold the students into exactly what they are looking for in a potential long-term employee.?"

894,Staff,1/9/2018 11:57 AM,"The talent gap we face in Florida is not a new problem nor is it unique to our state.

According to the Florida Chamber, while more than 400,000 are looking for jobs, we still have 232,000 jobs looking for people.

Florida's employers and workforce development, economic development and education entities are collaborating to bridge that gap with a new focus on apprenticeships.

The National Office of Apprenticeship, within the U.S. Department of Labor, has set a goal of doubling and diversifying the number of apprenticeships by 2019.

Florida is among 36 states and Guam recently selected to help make that big goal a reality through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative.

The responsibility tied to these grants is clear: Build partnerships across key industries and organizations to create a strong talent pipeline for businesses in vital industries like advanced manufacturing and information technology.

Last month, I had the opportunity to talk with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta during his visit with Gov. Rick Scott in Tallahassee about the importance of expanding apprenticeship opportunities.

Florida is the third largest state in the nation, with low unemployment - just 3.8 percent in September - and record job growth.

We know we still have construction companies in need of skilled workers, hospitals in need of health care technicians and manufacturers in need of production technicians.

The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine data series found more than 46,000 health care openings in Florida in September.

In the same month, we had more than 64,000 construction jobs open, 42,000 IT positions available, and more than 9,000 manufacturing jobs open.

Apprenticeships are a great way to get tomorrow's talent ready for the demand we know is here, and constantly growing.

CareerSource Florida is integrating apprenticeships into our statewide sector strategies initiative.

Sector strategies are a nationally recognized approach that brings together partners and stakeholders in industry, education and workforce development to align public resources that address the skills needs of critical industries.

Sector strategies, including apprenticeships, enable us to meet the talent demands of tomorrow and support state and local economic growth in a significant way.

Research shows sector strategies strengthen the participating businesses, the industries involved and the workforce as a whole by shifting workforce development from a supply-driven to a demand-driven approach.

Our work on the State Apprenticeship Expansion grant has already resulted in system-wide partnerships, and the engagement of nearly 100 industry and expert volunteers who are identifying ways to expand apprenticeships.

Each of Florida's lead organizations - CareerSource Florida, the Department of Economic Opportunity and the Department of Education - has designated a project director to focus on this important work.

We believe this renewed focus and the fresh insights of industry, education and workforce experts will further strengthen and diversify Florida's already robust economy.

The collaboration and commitment to build and grow strong apprenticeship programs throughout our state is a testament to Florida's leadership on a critical national issue.

Michelle Dennard is president and CEO of CareerSource Florida."
897,Sadie Layher,1/9/2018 6:00 PM,"One of the last thoughts by millennials as a vocational option is apprenticeship. The first instinct of students is to go to a college or university to get a safe career. However, college is not the only way to build a future.  Dr. David Strubler of Oakland University created a program called the Tiny House Apprenticeship pilot in August 2017 to teach a group of inexperienced men to create something with their hands. With direction, they created a fully functioning tiny house with no experience using power tools.

Jennifer Llewellyn, manager of Oakland County?s workforce development for Michigan Works!, also played a part in Strubler?s project. Both have similar philosophies regarding the lack of teens choosing to go into plumbing, electrical and construction-type jobs.  Llewellyn said she is ?passionate about individuals that are here to learn and earn? at the Tiny House Apprenticeship.  In regards to the tiny houses, it took roughly three months for five 20-23 year old men to complete one full house. The house itself was a 28-foot and 304-square foot tiny home and each man was exposed to the different trades."
901,Ali Meyer,10/10/2017  1:20 PM,"Sens. Tom Cotton (R., Ark. ) and Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) introduced the VALOR Act, which will help military veterans have more access to apprenticeship programs.  Currently, private apprenticeship training programs in multiple states are required to register with each state's approval agency, which increases the amount of paperwork and review processes they have to go through. Because of this, some of these programs have decided to limit themselves to a smaller number of states and have been discouraged from opening up programs for veterans.

The Veteran Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform Act would help streamline the certification process for these programs by allowing there to be a streamlined approval process.  ""To make employers register their apprenticeship programs in every single state they operate in is a needlessly burdensome requirement,"" said Sen. Cotton. ""It also has the perverse effect of making it harder to hire veterans. This legislation will cut through the red tape and help put more veterans in apprenticeship programs."""

As DPS prepares students for the future, we are rethinking pathways to education with innovative and collaborative solutions. Through a partnership with CareerWise Colorado, the CareerResidency Youth Apprenticeship Program offers DPS students three-year apprenticeships with a business-led, student-centered approach that addresses real-world needs. The apprenticeship program combines the traditional high school classroom learning with on-the-job experiences, giving students access to high-opportunity careers in top fields. Apprenticeship students are able to earn money, gain valuable work experiences, and even earn college credit while in high school through concurrent enrollment ? to prepare them to be successful in any career path they choose.  Students in the CareerResidency program recently attended a leadership retreat in Estes Park, where they learned how to develop valuable professional traits ? like how to work together and communicate within a team environment ? that will help them throughout their apprenticeship experience.

The event gathered around 60 DPS CareerResidency students with engaging activities such as team-building, outdoor ropes course, guided hiking, archery and more.  ?The retreat at Estes Park helped me to get to know everyone in the group, to feel part of the community and I also learned to speak up.

906,Matthew Patane,10/11/2017  11:22 AM,"Iowa Gov.

Reynolds spoke at an open house for the new training center for the Associated Builders and Contractors of Iowa.  The more than 10,000-square-foot training center at 1482 Hawkeye Dr. is a mix of classrooms and spaces for apprentices to work on equipment as they learn plumbing, electrical and HVAC skills.  ?Together, we have to just continuously focus our attention on the importance of the skilled trades,?

Apprenticeship Carolina had no impact on people of color?s share of new apprenticeship positions, but dramatically increased women?s representation in apprenticeship.

The growth in women?s participation is largely the result of the expansion of apprenticeship into occupations that traditionally employ women. These experiences are useful for guiding current and proposed federal expansion policies. Expansion efforts do not necessarily conflict with diversity and inclusion goals, although policymakers should continue to support women in traditionally male occupations."
911,Peter Georgescu,10/11/2017 11:40 AM,"One of the more encouraging developments of the current decade has been a burgeoning manufacturing renaissance in America.

Many of these jobs are returning from overseas, after a decade of flight to cheaper labor offshore, yet many are actually originating here.

According to Bloomberg, this is more of a movement than a trend: more than a third of American manufacturers with revenues larger than $1 billion will return jobs to the United States.

Move higher up in the revenue ranks, and the story gets better: almost half of U.S. firms with revenues over $10 billion are planning to do the same.

Manufacturing jobs declined from 17.3 million at the start of 2000 to an all-time low of 11.4 million in 2010.

That's when the trend reversed, and manufacturing jobs grew to 12.3 million by mid-2016.

This isn't simply the result of American innovation and the homecoming of lost American jobs.

A good many foreign companies are now ""Offshoring"" their own jobs and moving them into the United States.

You thought the textile industry in the U.S. was dead? Think again.

The Keer Group, a Chinese textile company opened a cotton mill two years ago in South Carolina.

A sister Chinese firm, JN Fibers, Inc., built a plant there as well.

ShriVallabh Pittie Group, from India, is building a textile factory in Georgia.

Tianyuan Garments Co. is setting up shop in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Shipping is becoming prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.

The U.S. has become a sensible place to make things-you can build your products only a one- or two-day truck ride from two thirds of the American market.

Foreign developers are drawn to states that offer tax credits, infrastructure grants, revenue bonds, assistance with worker training, and-believe it or not-continuous electricity.

Plus U.S. workers are now willing to work for less, especially in states that are make it harder to unionize.

For better or worse, new hires will work long shifts for lower wages than in the past, and they can multi-task on the plant floor in ways a union would usually prohibit.

It's a perfect storm of conditions favorable to foreign investment in U.S. job growth.

Though all of this raises thorny questions about worker safety, exploitive practices and low wages, it suggests that we might be seeing the dawn of parity for American workers in the global economy.

With time and effort, these companies will have the opportunity to motivate workers to produce dramatic improvement in productivity and innovation.

One of the brightest spots in this story actually serves as an example of how companies ought to handle their most precious resource-employees.

It also shows the way to hire people who may not be entirely qualified on Day One, but can quickly adapt and learn on the job.

This is essential because manufacturing jobs require much higher skills than in the past.

As you may have already noticed, is a bellwether for this new manufacturing.

It has created new partnerships between government and business to create fast-track training for newly hired manufacturing workers.

A German car maker has become its biggest and most publicized partner.

Even though BMW uses 1,400 robots to build luxury SUVs, it still needs 10,000 workers to fill in the gaps and make sure the machines are getting the job done properly - that's total employment following an addition of a 1,000 jobs announced in June.

One can start with BMW even though, strictly speaking, the new hires are unqualified to jump into the job immediately because BMW has a ""Dual-track"" training program.

They learn while they earn, working under a certified Apprenticeship, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Labor.

It's a dream come true for both young workers getting into the job market as well as mid-career types who have been displaced or are simply looking for a better future.

These recruits go to school and get paid an hourly wage while they're doing it.

It's been twenty years since BMW located its plant in Spartanburg and, in that time, he has created more than 23,000 American jobs, with a total capital investment of $4.6 billion, as of 2015.

Spartanburg had job openings in the military or at Wal-Mart.

Though apprenticeships have been on the decline in the U.S. for many years, this proves that it's a viable way to build a skilled workforce, at a time when college degrees are more expensive than ever and trade schools haven't yet caught up with the sort of jobs that require new skills now.

What BMW has done in South Carolina offers a template to address multiple roadblocks to economic growth: inadequate education, the decline of American manufacturing, and income inequality.

In all respects it shows how we can revive and grow economic sectors we've all but given up on for so many years.

The other states in our nation ought to look to South Carolina for some job-growth lessons.

How many categories, beyond automotive, can be identified and attracted to our shores? An aggressive search by private industry, states, and the federal government can produce great paying jobs for countless unemployed, as well as youngsters moving into the job market.

What's going on today should give us both hope and determination to grow."

914,Staff Report,10/12/2017  3:00 AM,"Apprenticeships remain a relatively fragile mode of vocational education, despite growing political interest internationally, according to new Oxford University research.  In the study, People and Policy: A comparative study of apprenticeship, researchers from Oxford University's Department of Education have for the first time reviewed apprenticeship participation on a global scale. Conducted in collaboration with the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), an initiative of Qatar Foundation, the research assesses apprenticeship frameworks in eight countries: Australia, Denmark, Egypt, England, Finland, Germany, India, and South Africa.

Apprenticeships play an important role in supporting young people to make the transition from school to working life and supporting adults in advancing their skills or acquiring new professions.  However, the findings suggest that reliance on the active participation of employers makes the apprenticeship model more vulnerable than classroom-based forms of learning, which can be delivered by state-sponsored colleges acting without direct employer support. For the model to work and produce successful, qualified apprentices, employer engagement is crucial, the authors suggest. Therefore, having strong incentives for employers to participate in programme provision is vital."

922,Howard Marklein,10/14/2017 2:00 PM,"I grew up on a dairy farm. From a very young age, I milked right alongside my dad. As I grew, I took on more responsibility and learned how to do new things. I was a part of our family business and knew the value and satisfaction of hard work. I credit these experiences for my strong work ethic and lifelong drive to do my best every day.  When I heard about the Eberle family, which owns The Mixing Bowl Bakery in Sauk City, I knew I needed to take action. Last year, a customer from the bakery filed a complaint with the Department of Workforce Development because several of the Eberle?s nine children were working in the bakery. The kids were clearing dishes, washing tables, making change and other small tasks. Curtis and Vicki Eberle were investigated and told that their children could not work at the bakery without a work permit. Since most of the kids are fairly young, they do not qualify for a work permit. Thus, none of the Eberle?s children are allowed to help at the bakery anymore.

I decided to author Senate Bill 420 to allow a minor to be employed without a child labor permit if they are working at a business owned by their parents, guardians or grandparents. Current child work permit exemptions already exist for agricultural work, domestic employment, work in or around a private home (such as babysitting or yard work), volunteer work for a nonprofit agency and work through the Youth Apprenticeship Program. Similarly, federal law also exempts children of any age from child labor minimum age requirements if they are employed in a family business, with some exceptions for hazardous occupations.  Some of the best lessons a child can learn take place when they are working alongside their parents. Farm kids are some of the hardest workers with the best work ethic in our state. I learned many skills on our family farm: responsibility, problem solving, etc. Under current law, a minor does not need a work permit to work on the family farm. A family business should be treated the same way."

The problem is that many of the people who want to work don?t have the skills needed for the available jobs. 

The task force was created under President Trump?s June executive order to identify strategies to expand apprenticeships. The group will be chaired by U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta and is responsible for issuing a report to the President with recommendations on national initiatives, administrative and legislative reforms, and private-sector participation.

The DOL today announced the members of a presidentially mandated task force on apprenticeship. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June to cut back the government's role in creating and monitoring apprenticeship programs and to shift more oversight power to trade groups, labor unions and businesses.  Trump signed his executive order before the August rally in Charlottesville that drew white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and at which one counter-protester was killed.

But in the wake of upheaval following Trump's comments on the violent rally in Charlottesville, VA, a number of executives lined up for the apprenticeship committee ended up not participating in it at all, including Mark Benioff of Salesforce and Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser, according to Politico.  President Trump issued an executive order in June to funnel money to apprenticeships as well as cut back the government's role in monitoring them. In announcing the committee members, DOL Secretary Alexander Acosta stated the administration's belief that apprenticeships will help close the skills gap and give American workers relevant skills for sustainable jobs.

Apprenticeships could be one resolution to the skills gap and impending job loss from automation, which employment experts say will foster the need for an upskilled workforce. That is, at least, the belief of the Trump administration, which views apprenticeship programming as one of the main goals of Acosta's DOL.

The local 1199SEIU chapter and UMMC Midtown hope to help about 15 entry-level workers in jobs like food service, transportation and janitorial work obtain their Certified Nursing Assistant certifications.  They will also help further train three to five current CNAs to become certified as patient care technicians."
958,Allen Smith,10/19/2017 1:02 PM,"Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta outlined a ""Common-sense regulatory agenda,"" and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Acting Chair Victoria Lipnic said it's a ""New day in terms of regulatory approach"" at the Association of Corporate Counsel annual meeting in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 18.The Department of Labor's agenda includes advancing tax reform, apprenticeships, and associated health plans, and reworking several rules, including ones on overtime, persuader activities, fiduciary responsibility and tip credit.

Lipnic noted that in the 2017 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, the EEOC reduced its backlog of charges to the lowest level in 10 years and increased the number of lawsuits brought.

The commission cut back on the number of systemic lawsuits.

Acosta asked the attendees to ""Take a breath and realize how well the economy is doing right now."" He noted that the unemployment rate is at 4.2 percent, the lowest it has been in 16 years, and that gross domestic product rose 3.1 percent in the second quarter.

The country can accelerate growth if it gets tax reform and apprenticeships right, he said.

He said tax reform should be thought of as a jobs bill.

It would allow businesses to expense capital investments for five years, for example.

If a company buys new equipment, the business will need someone to operate it, he said.

Apprenticeships are a ""Wonderful way for businesses to fill positions,"" Acosta said, promoting a task force on expanding apprenticeships announced Oct. 16.

""Workforce education matters,"" he said, adding that it leads to greater productivity and retention.

""Regulatory stability contributes to pro-growth,"" he said.

""Businesses should be able to predict what the future will look like.""

They also should know what the law is, which is why the DOL is bringing back opinion letters, he noted.

Several of these guidances are being rescinded because the administrative state has grown far too much in power and authority, Acosta said, emphasizing that the regulatory process would be used to rescind rules.

Improvements at EEOC.During her talk to conference attendees, Lipnic noted that she has made it a priority to reduce the EEOC's backlog of charges.

She predicted reducing it further when the EEOC is fully staffed with commissioners again.

Currently, Lipnic is the only Republican on the five-member commission.

Two more Republicans, Janet Dhillon and Daniel Gade are awaiting a Senate vote to confirm their nominations.

Chai Feldblum and Charlotte Burrows will remain on the commission as its only Democrats.

While the EEOC litigates only a small percentage of the charges it receives, the commission's general counsel brought 184 lawsuits in district court last fiscal year, many more than the previous fiscal year's historic low of 86.

""I believe in strong enforcement,"" Lipnic said.

She noted that the commission reduced its systemic cases to 30 last year, saying the commission needed a course correction.

Trying to take every lawsuit on a systemic basis was proving difficult for the EEOC, she said.

The EEOC is now pursuing charges on a narrower geographic basis.

As for its wellness program rule, Lipnic emphasized that the commission's rule was not vacated but that the court instead sent the rule back to the commission to re-examine its justification for the rule.

The EEOC anticipates having a proposed rule in August 2018 and a final rule in 2019.The Office of Management and Budget suspended the EEOC's pay reporting requirements of the EEO-1 rule, which would have been due with the rest of the EEO-1 report on March 31, 2018.

""It's hard to speculate what the new members will do"" about the pay reporting requirement, she said, but Lipnic noted that she voted against the pay reporting requirement.

She cautioned that if the EEOC retains a pay reporting requirement, it would not pre-empt states' requirements.

She said that the OMB will more closely scrutinize any subregulatory action, such as guidance, going forward.

Toward the end of the presentation, during a discussion of a recent court decision that held that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not require leave, Lipnic said that she does not think the ADA was meant to be a leave law, either.

She added that the EEOC says leave can be an accommodation but added that ""The idea that it can go on and on forever is problematic.""

966,Staff Report,10/20/2015  12:11 AM,"An upcoming panel presentation in Woodstock will highlight the benefits of apprenticeships.  The presentation will be Nov. 14 at the McHenry County Administration Building, 667 Ware Road, Woodstock, and it will be hosted by the McHenry County Workforce Network, according to a news release from the group.

Apprenticeships help address a skills gap and contribute to economic development by preparing the workforce to meet technical needs, such as an acoustical specialist to an X-ray equipment tester, according to the release.  Participants will learn about apprenticeship work and where to start with one, the difference between registered and nonregistered apprenticeships, and funding and resources to support an apprenticeship."
969,Nicholas Wyman,10/20/2017 6:54 PM,"American employers have complained for years about a shortage of skilled workers-not only in the traditional trades, but in tech, healthcare, manufacturing, and service sectors.

The current administration aims to close that ""Skills gap"" by dramatically increasing the number of company-sponsored apprenticeships.

Early in 2017, the President bought into a five million apprenticeship challenge laid down by Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce.

Succeeding in this would boost apprenticeship opportunities one hundredfold and, on a per capita basis, put the U.S. on par with Switzerland and Germany, where the apprenticeship tradition is strong.

Those nations have robust and diverse economies, along with strikingly low levels of adult and youth unemployment.

Apprenticeships have been a common feature of work life in Europe since the late Middle Ages.

Over the centuries they have offered young people a learning alternative to academic schooling, which was reserved for the wealthy.

Even today, with modern primary and secondary educational systems in place, apprenticeships are valued and popular pathway to well-paid careers.

Many European employers, large and small, look to their apprenticeship systems as key sources of human talent.

Those apprenticeships are not locked in the past but have kept pace with economic change and the needs of employers.

In Switzerland, for example, 70% of high school graduates enter apprenticeships in ""New-collar"" fields such as IT, banking, healthcare, hospitality and advanced manufacturing.

As in Germany, Swiss apprentices are engaged in a dual training system that features two to four years of both classroom instruction and paid on-the-job training under the watchful eyes of skilled mentors.

Upon completion, the vast majority is offered full-time positions with the companies that sponsored their apprenticeships.

Young people in Switzerland have the option of entering apprenticeships before completing high school.

How is a 16 or 17-year-old supposed to know which life path to choose? However, the flexibility of the Swiss system allows apprentices to change industries, specialize in particular functions, and even pursue university degrees.

Thus, apprentices are not pigeonholed into rigid career paths; rather, they are encouraged to explore different fields.

It is not surprising to learn that many Swiss managers and executives began their careers as humble apprentices.

To ensure financial sustainability and high quality, the Swiss apprenticeship system, like its German counterpart, is jointly governed and funded by the public and private sectors.

Cantons, the federal government, trade associations and companies collaborate closely to design curricula, standards and training programs.

Those programs are designed to fill the real needs of modern enterprises, which make them essential talent pools for some of the world's largest companies such as ABB, Accenture, The Adecco Group, UBS, and Nestle among them.

We can learn many lessons from the apprenticeship systems of the Swiss, and other countries as governmental entities and businesses in this country gear up for more skill-oriented training.

Naturally, we should not adopt their systems in their entirety, but adapt their best features to the unique U.S. business/labor environment.

Most young people in Western Europe leave high school with more solid backgrounds in science and math than do youngster here; that difference must be accommodated.

European executives are comfortable with collaborations that involve themselves, unions and government.

U.S. execs, on the other hand, have generally favored more arm's length relationships.

The U.S. has some distinct advantages that can be leveraged.

Its infrastructure of two-year community and tech colleges has no equivalent on the other side of the Atlantic.

Greater decentralization of power in the U.S. means that some state and local governments can-do-response quickly to local opportunities.

Recognizing the magnetic power of a highly skilled workforce in attracting new employers, many local entities are demonstrating remarkable creativity and zeal in advancing the cause of apprenticeship training within their jurisdictions.

They are not waiting for Washington to get its act together.

That's one of the strengths of the American system.

Some of the very best lessons can be learned from Swiss companies that have expanded operations into the U.S., bringing their training cultures with them.

These enterprises are demonstrating how the mechanisms of Swiss apprenticeships can be adapted to the American scene.

They are taking American people as they are and grooming them for success.

They are also forging collaborative relationships with local governments, school districts, and community colleges.

In the whole talent ecosystem in the US between employers, educators, industry groups, local, state and federal governments is a challenge, as this is a new territory for some.

Employers must lead these partnerships as they define labor needs and provide jobs."
970,Staff,10/22/2017 10:01 AM,"A nonprofit primary care, specialty outpatient and sub-specialty medical group practice with over 200 physicians and multiple patient care locations across the state, announces the launch of its Apprenticeship Program for medical assistants employed by UM who wish to become Licensed Practical Nurses.

The program is the result of a collaborative effort initiated by UM between Community College of Rhode Island and Building Futures/.

It is funded in part by University Medicine and by a grant CCRI received from the State of Rhode Island Governor's Workforce Board.

Rhode Island was one of 38 states to be awarded the American Apprenticeship Initiative Grant in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama with the goal to expand apprenticeship in nontraditional trades industries nationwide.

"" University Medicine's program marks the first time an apprenticeship is tied to an LPN curriculum in the nation,"" states Dr. Louis B. Rice, president and CEO of University Medicine.

""No other program like this for LPNs exists - the closest apprenticeship program model can be found in England. It is also groundbreaking for CCRI to offer such a customized program onsite to meet the specific needs of our employees. We are grateful for this highly collaborative effort that results in significant career growth opportunity for our staff.""

UM's LPN Apprenticeship Program trains medical assistants on staff who are interested in pursuing careers as licensed practical nurses.

The Governor's Workforce Board grant provided CCRI with funding for a three-month collaboration with UM to design the LPN curriculum around an apprenticeship model.

CCRI staff assesses the level of academic readiness for program candidates and identifies required courses needed to successfully enter the Practical Nursing Program at CCRI. This past year, courses such as math and biology were delivered onsite at the UM Patient Center at 375 Wampanoag Trail in East Providence, and onsite advisors provided assistance with entrance placement testing and the application process.

A customized schedule for the courses was developed so the employees could conveniently take classes at times which least impacted their professional duties at UM. ""We are seeing employers eager to have academic opportunities to offer to their employees,"" comments CCRI VP of Academic Affairs Rosemary Castigan.

""University Medicine's program is a great example of a partnership between the academic side and workforce development side of CCRI, delivering college services to employees in a way that is very specific and respectful of their work time, and creating a deeper connection with the employer. This is not just about offering a standard course or training onsite which we have done in the past, rather this is tailoring our course schedules and bringing placement testing and advisor services onsite to work directly with the individual students, to fully prepare them to enter the LPN program. For a CNA or a medical assistant, it is the natural next step in their career.""

After the course curriculum was developed, ARI worked with UM to design and develop the apprenticeship phase of the program, acting as intermediary between the state for registering the apprenticeship and assisting with required paperwork.

Four UM employees have been accepted into the LPN apprenticeship program.

""Once the UM employees enter the nine-month Apprenticeship Program, they can continue working a reduced schedule,"" explains Dr. Rice.

""Although the curriculum timeframe was customized for our employees, the content and rigor of the program remains unchanged and is exactly what a non-UM employee would go through if they were enrolled in CCRI's LPN program on a full-time basis. Together with our program partners, we've identified the skills and competencies needed in order to become competent, full-fledged LPNs. What makes our program unique is that they will spend a year on the job learning as an apprentice. It is paid employment and not a temporary internship or clinical rotation experience in a purely academic context.""

""Apprenticeship in the healthcare sector makes sense,"" comments Andrew Cortu00e9s, executive director of Building Futures, the home of Apprenticeship RI. ""University Medicine is a great example, using apprenticeship to upskill medical assistants to become licensed practical nurses through an innovative partnership with us and the Community College of RI. Standardizing the skill levels of these critically important caregivers ensures that everyone wins."""
972,Staff Report,10/23/2017  1:00 PM,"Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance Ted Nickel and Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Secretary Ray Allen announced today the approval of the Wisconsin Apprenticeship Credit Program as proposed by the Wisconsin Compensation Rating Bureau (WCRB).  The program will benefit employers who hire and currently employ an apprentice through the state's Registered Apprenticeship program.  ?In Wisconsin, we are seeking innovative ways to grow talent and meet employers' need for skilled workers, and this new program will further enhance Wisconsin's century-old apprenticeship program as a critical workforce development tool,"" Commissioner Nickel said. ""I would like to thank the Wisconsin Compensation Rating Bureau for their innovative efforts in creating this program.""
 
The new program, approved by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance on September 28, will offer a 2% premium credit up to $2,500 on an employer's Worker?s Compensation (WC) premium if they employ an apprentice through Wisconsin?s Bureau of Apprenticeship Standards (BAS). The credit would be optional for policies written in the voluntary market and mandatory for companies in the Insurance Pool effective October 1, 2018.  Companies interested in the credit should contact their individual insurance carrier for details.  ?This is another example of Wisconsin businesses working with stakeholders to advance the state's economy and encourage more employers use Registered Apprenticeship to fill their skilled talent needs,"" Secretary Allen said. ""After more than 100 years of innovation, Wisconsin Apprenticeship remains a premier program to equip workers with the skills needed for jobs today and in the years to come."""
974,Deborah Lockridge,10/23/2017  12:00 PM,"The Trump Administration will make it easier for groups such as the American Trucking Associations and the trucking industry to put in place apprentice programs to cross the job skills gap and help address driver and technician shortages, said U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta at ATA?s Management Conference & Exhibition.  ?American companies have 6.1 million job openings today,? Acosta said. ?That?s a record high, almost the highest since we started keeping these statistics. There were 247,000 in transportation and warehousing as of this month?s report. Job creators want to hire. And Americans want to work, with nearly 7 million individuals looking for jobs. Job seekers need different skills to fill the open jobs. This is frequently referred to as the skills gap.?

One solution, he said, and one the Trump administration is pushing, is rapid expansion of apprenticeship programs. The administration is creating something called ?industry recognized apprenticeships.? The U.S. Department of Labor Task Force on Apprenticeship.  ?Apprentices earn skills for which there is actual demand,? Acosta said. ?You?re educated in something for which there are jobs open. Second they earn while they learn, lessening the burden of student debt. Third, apprentices gain expertise from the real experts in the field.?"

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, apprenticeships have dramatically impacted the lives, careers, and opportunities for millions of workers, and more than 150,000 businesses over the last 80 years, from careers in health care, energy, and IT to manufacturing, transportation, and more.  The benefits of apprenticeships, for both companies and individuals, are substantial. Businesses that offer apprenticeship programs are able to diversify their workforce, improve productivity and profitability, standardize training, reduce turnover, receive tax credits, and more. For apprentices, the average starting wage is more than $60,000 per year, and workers will earn an average of $300,000 more over their lifetime than their non-apprentice peers.

As part of National Apprenticeship Week, the Apprenticeship Celebration will include hands-on demonstrations from apprenticeship exhibitors, panel presentations from apprentices, as well as a tour of the WATR Center and a BBQ for all attendees.

One of Benioff?s passions is apprenticeships; he believes that if the U.S. had an apprenticeship system like Germany or Australia, it could make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, especially among the millions of people who lack college degrees.  After quickly introducing himself, Benioff cut to the chase. ?We?d love to encourage you to take a moonshot goal of creating 5 million apprenticeships in the next five years,? he told Trump.  ?Let?s do that,? replied the president, breaking into a big smile. ?Let?s go for that 5 million. Okay??

Last week, in an announcement that was barely noticed, the Labor Department unveiled its Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion. In addition to three cabinet secretaries?Betsy DeVos at Education, Wilbur Ross at Commerce and Alexander Acosta at Labor?the panel will include several chief executives of Fortune 500 companies, some union representatives and the heads of key lobbying groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. Plus John Ratzenberger, the actor who played Cliff Clavin, the postal carrier on ?Cheers.? He's an advocate for skills training.  This is hardly an encouraging first step. Government-appointed task forces rarely make the kinds of bold recommendations needed to jump-start a new idea. That will be especially true of this panel. There are too many interest groups with too many competing agendas to reach the necessary compromises, so the final report is likely to be mush. Like so much else with Trump, it's hard to imagine this apprenticeship push amounting to anything."

The panel will offer proposed ?administrative and legislative reforms? and ?effective strategies for amplifying and encouraging private-sector initiatives.?  ABC says the construction sector needs to hire an estimated 500,000 skilled workers to fill existing backlog, which could double if a large Trump infrastructure program happens.

991,Ed Coghlan,10/25/2017 5:07 PM,"Because the Head Start program at the YMCA of the East Bay has a collective bargaining agreement with SEIU Local 1021, there is ongoing collaboration and communication between them. When SEIU learned that the YMCA was launching an apprenticeship program last summer, and the YMCA learned that through the SEIU Early Educator Training Center (SETC) the union was developing several state-registered apprenticeships, the advantages of a partnership were obvious. The California Apprenticeship Initiative presented the perfect opportunity to formalize the partnership, expand the YMCA?s apprenticeship, and replicate/expand the SEIU Early Educator Apprenticeship that had been piloted in L.A. County.  We aimed to adapt the SEIU Early Educator Apprenticeship to meet the unique professional development and training needs of the Head Start sector of the early care and education workforce. Another goal was to fully incorporate the YMCA apprenticeship into a larger, multi-faceted program. The YMCA apprenticeship, which focuses on providing unemployed Head Start parents with an on-ramp to entering the field of early care and education, became Tier 1 of the Head Start Apprenticeship. Tiers 2 and 3 resemble the upper level tiers of the SEIU Early Educator Apprenticeship and focus on supporting Head Start workers to earn AA and BA degrees in order to meet the Head Start training requirements for teachers and master teachers.

Students have received individualized academic guidance and advisement, which is essential for this group of non-traditional students. They have also participated in college classes as part of an apprenticeship cohort, and the benefits of learning with peers are enormous. The program allows them to take no-cost college courses (tuition is paid for), have textbooks paid for, and take classes at times and in locations that are responsive to their work schedules and family responsibilities.  Employers have benefited by having teachers who are better trained, better prepared, and more confident in their knowledge and competency as early childhood professionals. Employers have also benefited by having a greater pool of entry-level workers who are well trained, thereby beginning to address the enormous shortage of Head Start workers."

John Ratzenberger, best known for his role as the know-it-all postal worker Cliff Clavin from Cheers and, to millennial audiences, as Hamm the Piggy Bank from Toy Story.  It?s a good thing to see a blend of new and established faces at the table on apprenticeship. But if the goal is to expand high-quality apprenticeship, there are concerning omissions. First, where are IT and healthcare? Expanding apprenticeship means expanding it to more industry sectors. Two important targets in recent years have been the IT and healthcare industries. Both are fundamental to American competitiveness. Both are already major sources of growth for high-quality jobs. Both have exciting apprenticeship innovations underway. That neither are at the table is as strange as it is unfortunate.

The same goes for small- and medium-sized businesses. When big-name companies engage with apprenticeship, it grabs headlines and sends a signal to the industry as a whole. Businesses with fewer than 250 employees provided jobs for nearly half of American private-sector workers in 2016, however, and they play a similarly large role in our apprenticeship system. Do we want more large corporations engaged with apprenticeship? Absolutely. But if the Task Force is trying to devise a plan to make it easier and more attractive for businesses to start an apprenticeship, it's small and medium sized employers that most need support. Despite plenty to pick from among the Department?s ApprenticeshipUSA Leaders, the Task Force leaves this crucial voice in the wilderness."
998,Latest Press Releases From Newswire.com,10/26/2017 6:12 AM,"Seven economically disadvantaged students who entered a carpenter pre-apprenticeship program have graduated and enrolled into a full-time apprentice program with the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters.

The Northeast Carpenters Apprenticeship Training Fund/Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, partnered with the Orange County Employment and Training Administration to sponsor the pre-apprentice program.

The idea was that it could serve as a steppingstone for economically disadvantaged youth, 18 to 24, who lived at the poverty level but want to work and find a career.

The pre-apprenticeship curriculum introduced the candidates to the skills and challenges of being union carpenters.

During the six-week, 240-hour coursework, they received a sampling of subjects that a full-time apprentice carpenter faces, including construction math, concrete, framing and working with metal studs.

The program allows candidates to sample the carpentry profession.

""The program was a great success because those who enrolled had a real-life glimpse of what it's like to learn and work as a union carpenter,"" said Dennis Yorke, coordinator for the Northeast Carpenters Training Fund Program.

""What we do isn't easy, but it is also fulfilling,"" says Yorke.

""The pre-apprenticeship program gives them an unvarnished view of a carpenter's work life."" Graduates of the program can immediately enter a five-year apprenticeship program consisting of classroom and hands-on training earning journeyman status.

""Union apprentices are paid during the apprenticeship program, and when they graduate, they have no debt and a job waiting,"" says Yorke.

All pre-apprentice candidates undergo a screening process that includes basic education requirements, having access to transportation and passing a drug test.

Yorke recalls the pre-apprentices returning to the classroom at 3 p.m. one day, covered in baby powder from head to toe.

""It was a great sight because even though they labored all day, covered in baby powder to protect their skin as they learned how to install insulation, they seemed happy. I asked one of the apprentices what was it like, and he said, 'It's great. Now I know how to do this.'"".

Melzina Canigan-Izzard, 24, a Newburgh native, joined the pre-apprenticeship program last spring.

She joined the apprenticeship program, committed to becoming a journeyman carpenter.

""It's exciting, and I love it,"" said the enthusiastic Canigan-Izzard.

She admits having been ""Handy"" and being self-taught, but the carpenter's program brought structure into her training.

She said people are surprised when they ask her occupation.

""Some people have a stereotype about women being dainty and it's nice to know that I can do whatever the male carpenters do,"" she said.

""I like being a role model and I hope that more women join the carpenter's union. We can do anything.""

The Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters represents nearly 40,000 hardworking men and women in Delaware and New Jersey and portions of Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania.

NRCC is one of the largest trade unions on the East Coast.

This year marked the 3rd Annual Women Can Build Career Skilled Trades Fair, an all-day event for women to gain hands-on experience and learn about the opportunities available in the field of construction.

About 150 of them were Oakland students who Emiliano Sanchez, the director of Career and Technical Education/Trades and Apprenticeship with Oakland's school district, organized to be a part of this event.

""This event is really important, because the skills trade in construction is less than three percent for women,"" said Sanchez.

""We need to expose all our students, but in particular our female students, so that they know not only can they enter but they can excel."""
1003,Staff,10/29/2017 12:23 PM,"DECATUR - Some Central Illinois unions and contractors face a continued struggle finding what for generations were in abundant supply in this region - qualified workers.

The seemingly contradictory condition in a community with high unemployment is causing the industry to rethink how new talent is attracted, as good jobs go unfilled and above-average growth is projected.

""There are surely enough unemployed people to fill those positions,"" said Bill Francisco, president of the Decatur Trades and Labor Assembly, AFL-CIO. ""Getting the skills that are needed is the obstacle we face.""

Trade jobs like plumbers, carpenters, welders, mechanics, electricians and construction workers are in demand, but there are a limited number of applicants who fit the qualifications.

Industry experts point to a gap in educational opportunities and cultural factors, such as the societal pressure to pursue a four-year degree, as barriers to bringing in the next generation of workers across the country.

The result: New talent isn't entering the pipeline fast enough to offset retiring workers.

The average age of the trades and labor assembly is about 37 years old, Francisco said.

Nationally, there are an estimated 6 million vacant jobs across all sectors, but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects faster-than-average job growth across vocational fields over the coming decade, rebounding after a series of declines following the recession a decade ago.

The following increases are projected by 2026:.76,300 trade supervisor jobs for construction and extraction workers.

The biggest demographic among Local 146 members are those 55 and older, said Jason Drake, apprenticeship coordinator with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, IBEW Local 146.

New apprentices begin every year, but there are always more workers leaving the field than entering it.

""We are going to have a sudden shortage in experienced electricians, and a gap around the same age with so much experience in the trade and they are going to be gone,"" he said.

When Braden England thinks of jobs in the trades or manufacturing, his mind originally conjured images of hundreds of workers shuffling drearily through routine work.

""We just think it's assembly lines building cars or building trucks like Caterpillar,"" said England, a senior at MacArthur High School who was among the hundreds to participate in a Manufacturing Days expo at Richland Community College that was meant to raise awareness of manufacturing and trade job opportunities.

""But they don't think of all the little things that have to go into it, or the required jobs you can go into. Something like camera work at ADM, or electricians that are required for the job.""

""It's probably just because when you hear manufacturing, you think about hard work and people not liking their jobs because they're building something in a hot factory,"" said Howard, a senior at MacArthur High School.

Especially after the economy crashed in 2008, high schools and popular culture pushed students toward a college education, Drake said.

Diminished funding for high-school trade and shop classes is another driving force behind the reduced number of applicants for apprenticeship programs, Francisco said.

Most area schools can't afford to teach the trade skills or even an introduction to the trades.

Guidance counselors often promote higher education in the form of a college degree, he said, which can cause the trades to be overlooked, even though they are another form of education.

The premise that students needed to continue their education after high school started about 15 years ago as a way to boost the number of qualified employees in the workforce, said Al Scheider, a guidance counselor at MacArthur who previously worked as a guidance counselor in Meridian schools.

As Scheider sees it, the message was intended to encourage students to consider options like trade jobs, vocational schools, community colleges and four-year colleges, but has been ""Misinterpreted"" to only include higher education.

The unpredictable nature of trades and construction work also scares off some potential recruits, Drake said.

While he acknowledged the possibility that a slow economy or other factors could affect skilled workers, Drake also tells apprentices they will always find a job as long as they are good workers.

Fuchs said that anyone with the necessary skills can travel across the country to find high-paying jobs, noting colleagues who have traveled to Ohio and Pennsylvania to get work when the local market is slow.

Francisco said he does see a changing tide, as people who already graduated from high school have started to grow interested in learning trades.

""You have people with two-and-four-year degrees realizing they would rather work with their hands or the money is better, which wasn't something pushed to them,"" he said.

""I've seen how the trades can help you with your life and help you make money,"" he said.

Apprenticeship programs vary for each union, but typically are free to the participants, and they often get paid for the training work they complete.

Once the program is completed, apprentices are required to work for five years to help pay back the costs of their education, Drake said.

""In our five years we are teaching you the trade in the classroom.""

When interviewing new applicants, Drake said he looks to accept people who want to work as an electrician until they retire.

He wants to employ people who are passionate about the work and enjoy it as well.

Nationally, construction jobs also have been in strong demand since the destruction of hurricanes in Texas, Louisiana and Florida this year.

""So one, the awareness piece: What is available, and how does it work? And two: What do we need to do to better prepare people for this pipeline?"" Wilkerson said.

Scheider said he works with students and schools to encourage trade jobs and trade education when thinking about a higher education.

They are working to get these classes and opportunities back for the students, he said, adding that to bring vocational training back to the schools would require partnerships with the local school districts, community colleges and employers.

His goal is for the academy to be an efficient central place for high quality trade education to occur so all the schools in the area don't have to offer the programs.

They teach engineering technology, drafting, industrial technology, an introduction to electrical work and welding to name a few.

The jobs are there, now they just need willing and able bodies to do the work."

1006,Staff,10/3/2017 10:43 AM,"Oct. 03-Campobello resident Jody Ledford climbed into an ambulance three years ago and hasn't looked back since.

Now a paramedic with Spartanburg EMS, he faces long days, high stress, a modest salary and little appreciation from some who call 911.

He said he understands why Spartanburg County, and the rest of the state, are dealing with a looming shortage of EMTs and paramedics.

""It's often a very thankless job... You really have to have a passion and a drive to want to do this kind of work,"" the 35-year-old said.

""You don't get into it lighthearted and thinking something's going to be fun like you see on TV. You want to help people.""

A shortage has placed a strain on call response times and workloads for those still in the industry.

There are 19 vacancies at Spartanburg EMS. Overtime is offered daily to cover the gaps.

The job outlook over the next decade is more reassuring.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the national emergency medical services profession growing by 24 percent by the year 2024.

Spartanburg Community College offers certificates to become an EMT and also a paramedic associate's degree that includes full class loads along with training at hospitals and inside ambulances.

Friday morning's paramedic class covered soft tissue care and burn injuries.

He said as Spartanburg County grows, EMS is seeing higher call volumes.

Currently, the agency handles about 150 calls per day.

""People will refer to a paramedic as an ambulance driver. We are so much more than that. The back of that ambulance is an emergency room on wheels that can do a lot of things that you get done in the hospital,"" Ledford said.

""Having a fully-staffed service with well-trained people is absolutely the difference between life and death of the public.""

EMS officials and state technical college representatives met in Columbia late last month to discuss ways to bring the industry back to full strength.

Leaders there say apprenticeships are available through Apprenticeship Carolina, a division of the S.C. Technical College System, where an agency could hire someone to work for them while that person is getting an education to become certified.

Essentially, those interested can start working sooner and have their education paid for along the way.

Officials at SCC and Spartanburg EMS say this is a new opportunity.

Both parties said they plan to meet with each other to work out an agreement in the near future.

EMS interim director Jeff Carroll said the paramedics and EMTs who came willingly into the profession in the 1970s are now moving onto nursing or physician assistant positions but the influx has not continued since then.

He said technical colleges have historically emphasized manufacturing jobs, so fewer people have been drawn to EMS. ""I think a lot of people have so many options for what they can do. We haven't done as good of a job as we should have with marketing or recruiting for the job itself,"" Carroll said.

Spartanburg EMS authorized a pay raise for paramedics and EMTs, bumping a starting salary up to $42,000 for paramedics and $31,000 for EMTs.

The countywide EMS agency runs stations throughout the county, utilizing a staff of 134 full-time and part-time paramedics and 53 full-time and part-time EMTs.

Response times tend to be slower, Carroll said, and with staff picking up overtime as a result of the shortage, they are not in peak working condition, Carroll said.

""Our employees have a passion for the job and are covering the shortage,"" Carroll said.

To become a paramedic, an associate's degree can be obtained in five semesters at SCC. Program Director Doug Paris has been a career paramedic since 1984.

He became the director of the EMS program at SCC in 2012.

""I want to give back to perpetuate the well-being of EMS,"" Paris said.

Paris said he will speak with Spartanburg EMS soon to gauge their interest in the Apprenticeship Carolina program.

""We could put people in paramedic class by January,"" he said.

Paramedic classes include topics of pharmacology, IV therapy, trauma management, medical diseases, pediatrics, geriatrics, EKG interpretation, HAZMAT, and weapons of mass destruction.

""They're paid for their readiness,"" Paris said of the level of education.

Phillip Logay, 18, of Boiling Springs, works as a firefighter for the Boiling Springs Fire Department but is continuing his education to become a paramedic.

He's taking classes now at SCC. ""The job itself requires high morale, and a lot of people don't have the guts for it,"" Logay said.

""Some people think they'll like it, and they start doing it and see blood and guts and they're out.""

Paris also coaches students on traumatic stress and what they will likely encounter on the job.

""We see things that people should not see,"" he said.

Carroll said getting EMS staff to high schools and community college classes to talk about the value of the profession is what is needed now.

""The expectation is that when you call what you want shows up and you get it. If we're not able to have quality people get training and make the connections that we need to make to keep people in those jobs, in your future that may not be the reality that you get,"" Carroll said."

1010,Daniel Axelrod,10/3/2017 7:30 PM,"Apprenticeship programs are already common for New York tradespeople like carpenters and electricians, and now seven more advanced manufacturing jobs will have them for the first time, too.  To fill a shortage of trained manufacturing workers, the New York State Manufacturers Alliance and its local affiliated organization, the Council of Industry, have partnered to roll out a new apprentice program to train Hudson Valley residents.

This month, local manufacturers began hiring applicants and signing up existing employees in new training programs for computer numeric controlled machinists, electro-mechanical and electronics technicians, automatic equipment maintenance workers, quality assurance auditors, toolmakers and welders.  Funded with a $500,000 state Department of Labor grant this year, and set for a five-year rollout, the state Manufacturers Alliance is providing the curriculum to the Council of Industry.  The council is offering the training programs to all manufacturers in the region, not just its trade group members."
1012,Elliott Mest,10/30/2017  9:50 AM,"The American Hotel & Lodging Association presented nonprofit career development organization Grads of Life with a commitment to provide $500,000 in grants to community-based organizations to recruit and develop ?opportunity youth? in high-demand markets, such as Washington D.C.; Los Angeles; Chicago; and Baltimore. U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta joined Lugar and Grads of Life principal Shawn Jacqueline Bohen to announce this investment.  Currently, 6 million young people??opportunity youth??are between the ages of 16 to 24, and out of school and out of work. Connecting them to potential employers is an important step in securing their future.

1016,Dawn Sweeney,10/30/2017 9:57 AM,"Are you a ""Regular"" at a restaurant? You know the place-the neighborhood spot you visit so frequently that the team members know your name.

Maybe they even know what you'll order before you sit down in your favorite booth.

You've come to love the experience and appreciate your favorite restaurant's quick service and friendly staff, but what you may not know is that those team members aren't just earning a paycheck.

They have the opportunity to gain fundamental values that will serve them well for the rest of their careers, including personal responsibility, hard work and discipline.

At the National Restaurant Association, we are working to offer opportunities to open doors for everyone.

The restaurant industry provides fundamental skills that help pave a career path for our employees.

Last year, our Educational Foundation was awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Labor to create the first ever federal apprenticeship program for the hospitality industry.

We teamed up with the American Hotel and Lodging Association and officially launched the Hospitality Sector Registered Apprenticeship project in February.

Through HSRA, we will place nearly 500 apprentices in the restaurant, foodservice and hospitality industries this year.

Here are four ways that this program will help transform our nation's workforce and create more career opportunities through apprenticeships.

Restaurant apprenticeships are about more than greeting guests or waiting tables - they offer training in a wide variety of professional skills.

The HSRA program gives apprentices the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skill sets through completion of several courses, including financial management, leadership strategy, branding and marketing, and front-of-the-house/customer service, among other topics.

Mastering these skills makes apprentices more desirable as managerial candidates and earns them opportunities to advance their careers, no matter the industry.

Apprentices can ""Earn while they learn."" Imagine that you learn not only on the job, but also have classroom learning to prepare you for a restaurant management career.

That is the essence of an apprenticeship program: ""Earn while you learn."" The classroom learning reinforces what you learn on the job and allows you to earn industry credentials, such as ServSafe Food Handler and ServSafe Manager, as well as a national, portable credential from the U. S. Department of Labor.

Apprenticeships benefit employees - and they also benefit businesses.

Employee retention is key to any successful restaurant's operations.

Managers often cite recruitment and retention as some of their top challenges, and as the economy improves and employment levels rise, competition for qualified employees increases.

Companies involved in apprenticeship programs often see improved workforce recruitment, a reduction in turnover and increased employee productivity, per the U.S. Department of Labor.

HSRA apprenticeships can be a model for more affordable and effective job training programs.

Apprenticeships offer an affordable alternative to a four-year degree without the burden of a six-figure student loan.

They provide employees with fundamental skills to guide them through their careers in ours or in any industry they ultimately choose.

The apprenticeship program is a prime example of how government and the business community can work together to create a stronger American workforce.

Together, we can build even more programs-in more industries-to create more jobs.

That's how we ensure our children and grandchildren are prepared for the job markets of the future.

That is why the National Restaurant Association supported the Trump Administration's Executive Order earlier this year to modernize, expand and streamline the apprenticeship process.

I am also honored to represent the restaurant and hospitality industry as a member of Labor Secretary Acosta's recently announced the White House Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion.

Now, we'll have even more opportunities to help employees in the hospitality industry build fulfilling and rewarding careers.

We hope you'll raise your glass to programs like this: ones that make for a more confident, more knowledgeable and more fulfilled restaurant team and a more prepared workforce for America's future."
1019,Betty L,10/31/2017 1:04 PM,"Business Acumen The profession leads the way in implementing effective recruitment, retention, retraining practices.

The workforce skills gap that U.S. businesses have been experiencing over the last several years has been outlined in numerous studies and publications.

A lack of individuals with fundamental employability skills, such as the ability to use basic math, communicate effectively, read technical manuals, work successfully in teams and participate in complex problem-solving.

A lack of workers who have specialized skills needed to fill many trade positions.

A lack of applicants with the science, technology, engineering and math skills needed for many of today's jobs.

These gaps have a significant impact on all of us in human resources, affecting many areas: the pool of qualified applicants we can provide to hiring managers, the amount of development we need to do internally to ensure that our employees are qualified to do their jobs, the pipeline of available talent for certain roles and potential successors, our ability to retain talent and the amount we have to pay to attract top talent.

Thankfully, SHRM-certified HR professionals, who have demonstrated proficiency in the Business Acumen competency, are able to apply an understanding of the labor market when developing a strategy to manage and compete for talent.

The biggest impact has been on the pool of qualified applicants available in the market.

The skills shortage has required talent acquisition specialists in organizations to get creative.

One solution has been to start the search for talent earlier in the targets' careers.

More companies are using internships to provide college students with opportunities to gain experience, making job offers at the end of summer internships in order to lock them in once they graduate.

Other organizations are offering internship assignments and mentoring opportunities to high school students.

Again, their goal is to help students learn about the workplace and about particular fields, and to provide them with work experience.

Companies are also onboarding talent where the talent is.

This approach allows organizations to tap into larger talent pools than are available in their local markets.

For positions subject to limited supply and high demand it is still difficult to find talent, even when an organization is unconstrained by location.

Further, employers are broadening their talent pool by working directly with military veterans and with organizations that assist veterans in transitioning to the private sector.

This is a great resource to find talent for specialized roles; however, a good understanding of how a veteran's military service and training translates to the role in the organization is essential-the relationship is often unclear.

This lack of clarity requires an organization to take a deeper look into how a veteran's experience might translate to the organization's needs, and to not rely solely on automated applicant tracking systems.

In some cases, the organization may be required to provide additional training to veterans to prepare them for their new role in the private sector.

SHRM-CPs and SHRM-SCPs are able to build and maintain a workforce that meets the needs of the organization, being well-versed in the functional area of Talent Acquisition.

Another method that organizations are using to attract talent is to increase their workplace flexibility options, drawing in skilled candidates who may not want to work full time or who want to make their own schedules.

Flexibility gives companies access to a broader, nontraditional applicant pool, including mothers returning to the workforce and older workers looking to step down from full-time opportunities while staying engaged.

Organizations are beginning to leverage creative incentives and benefits to attract and retain talent and increase recruitment effectiveness.

Student loan debt repayment, paid leave for new parents, free meals, unlimited vacation time, paid time off to volunteer in the community, enhanced 401(k) programs and onsite medical clinics are just a few examples.

Total Rewards is another functional area of HR Expertise that SHRM certificants have mastered.

They are able to design and oversee such creative strategies in alignment with their organizations' strategic direction and talent needs.

Another approach to the low supply of talent that some organizations are utilizing is to build their own talent.

Employees with a basic level of skills are developed into employees with more specialized skill sets specific to the organization's needs.

Apprenticeship-type programs in some companies combine internal or external training programs with on-the-job experience.

Other companies partner with local community colleges to create courses customized for employees to ensure that they meet specific organizational skills requirements.

SHRM-certified HR professionals who use best practices to develop and deliver the right learning and development activities for their organizations, closing gaps in employees' competencies and skills, are applying their own skills in the Learning & Development area of HR Expertise.

Even with all of these creative ways to broaden the talent pipeline, it is still extremely difficult for organizations to find talent.

Thus, the need for HR professionals with the ability to attract top talent will continue to increase as companies become more knowledge-based and require increasingly specialized skills.

We must ensure that we are preparing ourselves and our organizations to rise to the challenges of this competitive new talent landscape.

1029,Caroline Rabbitt Tabler,10/5/2017 8:00 PM,"Washington, D.C. - Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) along with Senator Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) today introduced the Veteran Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform (VALOR) Act, which would increase access to apprenticeship-training programs for military veterans. Specifically, it would streamline the certification process for non-federal apprenticeship programs based in more than one state.

""To make employers register their apprenticeship programs in every single state they operate in is a needlessly burdensome requirement. It also has the perverse effect of making it harder to hire veterans,"" said Cotton. ""This legislation will cut through the red tape and help put more veterans in apprenticeship programs.""

""Hiring veterans in the private sector should be as easy as possible, and Congress needs to do its part to increase opportunities for veterans in our workforce,"" said Senator Tillis. ""It is unnecessary to force businesses to register in every state of operation, and the VALOR Act is commonsense legislation that will reduce this burdensome requirement so apprenticeship programs will be more accessible to veterans.""

Background: Under current law non-federal apprenticeship training programs located in multiple states have to register with each state approval agency individually, subjecting them to mountains of paperwork and multiple burdensome review processes. In response, employers have decided to limit their programs to a smaller number of states and, as a result, hire fewer veterans. The VALOR Act would amend current law to allow for a single, more streamlined approval process."

She devoted most of her remarks to Apprenticeship Maryland.

Public schools in Washington and Frederick counties are serving as pilot efforts for the program. The two-year pilots will conclude with the end of this school year, and state officials will have to determine what to do going forward, she said.  Traditionally, apprenticeships have been linked to skilled trades, such as the courses offered through the Barr Construction Institute at the Associated Builders and Contractors Cumberland Valley Chapter in Hagerstown, she said."
1041,Staff,11/10/2017 1:35 AM,"The Michigan Statewide Carpenters and Millwrights Joint Apprenticeship and Training Fund recently broke ground on a state-of-the-art training center to service union carpenters and millwrights in the West Michigan region.

The training fund, which represents leaders in several Michigan labor unions, will finance the $14-million project, including the $1 million purchase of the property.

Schweitzer Construction out of Battle Creek will serve as the general contractor.

Kalamazoo-based Byce & Associates will provide architectural services.

Kevin Klingler, organizing director for the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters, said the decision to build the training center in Wayland was strategic to the area the MRCC wanted to serve.

""Wayland is very centrally located for the region that we want to service - from Ludington to the south state line,"" he said.

""We're servicing approximately 20 counties with this facility.""

Scheduled to open in late 2018, will be located at 700 Reno Drive and will be highly visible from U.S. 131, which Klingler hopes will increase public awareness of the training center.

The building will cover approximately 70,000 square feet, 50,000 of which will be designated for training space, including classrooms, training equipment and computer labs.

The center also will utilize a paperless curriculum, and certified, industry-trained instructors will lead both apprentice- and journeyman-level classes.

Classes will feature hands-on training, and apprentices will be able to work for area contractors and earn wages while in training.

""For a young person that is looking for a career, it's a great opportunity,"" Klingler said.

""You can start right out of high school, and you can earn while you learn.""

Klingler said the MRCC has had an apprenticeship program since the 1940s and operates seven training centers statewide, but the new training center will meet increasing technological demands.

""The buildings are getting older, and it's hard to keep up with technology,"" Klingler said.

""We can do a much better job training in a new facility.""

The training center also will partner with area contractors to better understand and respond to technological changes in the industry and alter its curriculum accordingly.

The MRCC currently has 270 apprentices in its program who will train for four years before they reach journeyman status.

Klingler said that by the time the new training center opens, he predicted there will be more than 300 enrolled apprentices.

""Journeymen come back for enhancement training to make themselves more applicable, make contractors more profitable,"" Klingler said.

The training center also will partner with high schools and have events for students to tour the facility and learn about career opportunities."
1042,Business Wire,11/10/2017 10:44 AM,"SAN FRANCISCO-()-In honor of Veterans Day Nov. 11, Wells Fargo & Company announced that it has donated more than $100 million since 2012 to support military service members, veterans and their families through financial education, career transition and housing initiatives.

Wells Fargo also announced new enhancements to its Hands on Bankingu00ae for Military money management curriculum to address the Department of Defense's new Blended Retirement System that goes into effect in 2018.

The new military retirement system combines the traditional legacy retirement pension with a defined contribution to service members' Thrift Savings Plan account.

Previously, approximately 81 percent of service members left military service without retirement benefits.

According to the Department of Defense, the modernized retirement system will provide retirement benefits for nearly 85 percent of service members.

""Wells Fargo is proud to support the needs of service members and veterans in many ways. From providing important financial education programs to donating to military and veteran-related initiatives to hiring thousands of veterans, we care deeply about these brave men and women who are serving and have served our country,"" said Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan.

""Our company has a long history of supporting the military from transporting troops in the mid-1800s to hiring specially trained phone bankers to work with service members beginning in 2013."".

Donated more than 350 homes, valued at more than $55 million, to veterans in all 50 states.

This year, Wells Fargo is presenting mortgage-free homes and payment-free vehicles to veterans during eight of the 16 Veterans Day Parades Wells Fargo is participating in across the country.

Hired more than 7,000 veterans, and participated in more than 950 military job fairs.

Launched Hands on Banking for Military, an online financial education program that has been viewed by more than 380,000 since July 2013.

Donated more than $47 million to military- and veteran-related nonprofits.

Wells Fargo has helped military members and veterans succeed financially for more than 164 years.

In May, Wells Fargo launched the company's ApprenticeshipUSA program for veterans.

The program offers companies the tools they need to develop a highly skilled workforce and provides veterans the opportunity to earn a salary while learning additional skills to succeed in high-demand civilian careers.

Wells Fargo offers veteran career transition initiatives, including the Veteran Employment Transition Internship Program, American Corporate Partners mentorships.

Scholarships and emergency grants through Scholarship America.

Wells Fargo provides financing options, dedicated service and financial education to help military members and veterans achieve homeownership.

On Nov. 6-8, military families were invited to attend free webinars on home financing, budgeting and saving, or credit.

The Wells Fargo Housing Foundation supports sustainable housing for veterans with programs including VeteranWINS, which granted $200,000 across six nonprofits in 2017, and $300,000 to improve 100 veterans' homes with Habitat for Humanity.

In collaboration with the Military Warriors Support Foundation, Wells Fargo donates homes and vehicles that are awarded payment-free to combat-wounded veterans.

Wells Fargo collaborated with the nonprofit Guideposts to provide 650,000 copies of ""Financial Readiness: Sound Principles for Successful Money Management"" to military service members since 2014.

The second edition, ""Building Wealth: Time to Plan for Your Future,"" will include a section devoted to the new Blended Retirement System and begins shipping to bases in late 2017.

Both publications leverage resources from the Hands on Banking for Military program.

1044,Staff,11/10/2017 12:40 AM,"When Americans make career choices, they should be encouraged to consider a broad range of options that fit their diverse talents and interests.

For many, their career path will take them to higher education.

A university degree is right for many young people, yet it is not the only route to career success.

We need to change the perception of a single ""Right"" career path.

To that end, we are encouraging leaders from business, labor, educational institutions and trade associations to recognize the benefits of apprenticeships.

Rep. Foxx's approach to this priority is shaped by her brother's experience.

He once asked her a heartbreaking question: Would she be ashamed of him if he didn't follow her down the path to college?

Her brother made a choice right for him, becoming a master carpenter.

Instead of pursuing an expensive degree that he did not need and that did not suit his goals, he obtained a certification that allowed him to launch a career.

An American working a job that is rewarding and meaningful should be celebrated in our nation.

When evaluating success, the focus should be on outputs instead of inputs.

Rather than focusing on higher education acceptance rates and tuition fees, we should focus on helping students access the programs that will actually help them achieve what they want to achieve in life.

We encourage leaders in middle school and high school education to reconsider the different ways they disproportionately judge student success through college acceptance rates.

Instead, the priority should be putting students on a path to career success - whether that is a university degree, a community college, or a workforce program.

We need to close the ""Career awareness gap."" Schools should show students the wide range of career options available to them, with details like salary information and educational requirements of those options.

Students deserve a fuller picture when they make important career decisions.

We need to increase opportunities to build skills through workplace education by rapidly expanding the apprenticeship model.

Apprenticeships enable students to earn while they learn.

Apprentices develop skills they can use across the country, meeting industry demand for skilled workers.

President Trump's executive order expanding apprenticeships in America boosts the apprenticeship model by directing the Department of Labor to work with business leaders, labor leaders, educational institutions, trade associations and public officials to promote new, high-quality apprenticeships.

This model inserts flexibility into the process so that stakeholders can design programs to meet the needs of their industries and be nimble enough to respond to the changes of a dynamic economy.

These initiatives will be custom solutions built to high standards and will not be micromanaged from Washington.

We are partners when it comes to modernizing workplace education.

With over 6 million Americans looking for jobs and more than 6 million open jobs nationwide, it's time to change how we prepare Americans for the workforce.

That starts with a commitment to respecting all career choices Americans make to develop the skills that will lead them to excel in family-sustaining jobs."
1045,Brandpoint (bpt),11/10/2017 2:10 PM,"With U.S. graduation rates being at an all-time high, one might expect employers to have a wealth of qualified candidates to hire.

Instead, many employers are finding that these recent graduates are unprepared to succeed in the workforce.

While many are graduating with technical skills, their ""Soft skills"" are lacking.

These skills - from professional communication and critical thinking to collaboration and time management - are seen as critical by employers, yet have not historically been taught with consistency or prioritized.

A recent whitepaper commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and AVID, an education nonprofit that equips students with the necessary soft skills needed to be successful in college and their careers, highlights recent partnerships between the business and education sectors to tackle this skills gap.

""Bridging the Soft Skills Gap: How Employers Can Partner with Educators to Prepare Students for the 21st Century Workforce"" offers practical recommendations for businesses to make an impact and profiles strategic partnerships being successfully implemented across the country by Nike, Ernst & Young, Wegmans, Wynn Las Vegas, and the Northern Kentucky Education Council.

According to a 2016 analysis by the Wall Street Journal, 92 percent of nearly 900 surveyed executives said soft skills were as or more important than technical skills, yet 89 percent reported some level of difficulty finding employees who have mastered these skills.

""With almost 6 million unfilled jobs in America, this lack of soft skills hurts workers, businesses and the economy,"" says Cheryl Oldham of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Center for Education and Workforce.

""Businesses recognize the critical need for soft skills and are working hard in their communities to help students obtain the skills they need to succeed in the jobs of tomorrow.""

A growing number of companies are focusing on student education as a part of their business strategy.

By equipping students with the skills for workplace success, they strengthen their talent pipeline and create shared value.

The following insights from the whitepaper offers successful approaches to collaboration between the education and business sectors to help youth become better prepared for their careers.

Investing in classroom solutions empowers teachers to better help young people develop the skills they need in school, work, and life.

Since promoting soft skills is less about what is taught than how they are taught, access to hands-on methodology training for educators is vital.

Employers can help by ensuring that teachers and administrators across local schools have access to proven professional development programs from established education nonprofits.

Businesses can mobilize employees to mentor students based upon a college and career readiness curriculum.

Proponents of these mentoring programs say that they enhance employee satisfaction and retention; strengthen the talent pipeline; and contribute to thriving communities.

In adopting a specific school or school district, businesses typically identify and commit to meeting a holistic set of needs through multifaceted programming, ranging from tutoring and mentoring to specific grants for programming and facilities.

Instead of solely offering traditional internships for college students, businesses can partner with high schools to establish pre-employment apprenticeship programs designed to introduce students to workplace demands.

The Department of Labor supports employers that establish Registered Apprenticeships to build a robust talent pipeline.

Building a coalition of representatives from industry, the education system, and the community creates the space for meaningful dialogue about common priorities and unique local challenges.

It also facilitates collective action around solutions."
1046,Business Wire,11/10/2017 3:17 PM,"SEATTLE-()-(NASDAQ: AMZN)-Amazon today announced it now employs more than 17,500 veterans and military spouses across the United States, and plans to hire over 10,000 more by 2021.

These full- and part-time roles are spread across the company-from the front-lines of Amazon's operations network to technical roles in Amazon Web Services-and come with comprehensive benefits including life and disability insurance, dental and vision insurance, with premiums paid in full by Amazon.

""We're very proud of the remarkable military talent we've hired at Amazon - more than 17,500 leaders who are inventing for customers every day across the company,"" said Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of HR. ""Our military recruiting teams have created hiring programs that place veterans and military spouses into roles that fit their unique backgrounds and provide the flexibility and skills training necessary to create long-term career paths at Amazon. We're still early in our efforts, and will keep expanding our pipeline of military talent in the years to come with more than 10,000 additional roles by 2021."".

Meet one of our 17,500 military employees, Amazon Air Director Sarah Rhoads, a Navy veteran who led Amazon's cargo planes to deliver roughly 200,000 pounds of relief supplies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Since pledging in May 2016 to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021, Amazon has launched innovative military hiring programs like Amazon's Military Leaders Program, which places mid-career veterans in fast-track operations leadership roles.

To ensure Amazon is meeting military spouses where they are, the company has expanded its Virtual Customer Services roles, which enable employees to work from their homes and take their jobs with them if they relocate.

Amazon invented the program to attract the best talent regardless of location, and it's particularly popular among military spouses who are often located near military bases or are required to frequently transfer to different locations, as well as wounded, injured or ill military veterans who work from home.

The company has already extended more than 2,000 VCS offers to military spouses and veterans in 2017.

In January, the Department of Labor certified Amazon as an official cloud computing Apprenticeship - meaning servicemembers and veterans can work directly with Amazon to go through a technical training program over 16 weeks, and participate in a paid apprenticeship with Amazon for 12 months.

These apprenticeships regularly lead to full-time technical roles at Amazon or elsewhere.

Amazon now offers apprenticeships in four locations-Seattle, Dallas, Northern Virginia and Oregon-and dozens of military members transitioning into civilian life are training in software development, cloud computing and data technician roles.

Amazon also works with nonprofit veterans groups like Camo2Commerce in Washington State and Maryland's Corp Career Connect program to train veterans in technical skills that prepare them for roles across Amazon.

Amazon also hosts dozens of transitioning servicemembers from the Hiring Our Heroes Fellowship program in roles across the company to help them effectively prepare for their transition to the private sector.

Amazon also advocates for veterans' issues across the country.

Amazon's public policy team coordinates across the public sector on ways to place members of the military community in meaningful jobs.

In the week ahead, as the country recognizes Veterans Day, Amazon is teaming up with the George W. Bush Institute for a series of conversations about how to ensure we're equipping and empowering veterans and military spouses for meaningful jobs.

""We know that civilian employment remains one of the most important transition issues that impacts veterans and military families,"" said Colonel Matthew Amidon, Director of the Bush Institute's Military Service Initiative.

""The Bush Institute is pleased to join Amazon in their tremendous efforts as we all work to ensure access to the meaningful careers that leverage the incredible leadership talent within our armed forces.""

The first event will be in Chicago with veteran business owners and local leaders on November 10.

Amazon will host its capstone event at the George W. Bush Institute on November 13, bringing together tech companies, elected officials across Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, and military business owners for a half-day conversation about efforts to employ, retain and empower veterans.

Amazon is also celebrating veterans and military spouses in recognition events across its operations network in select fulfillment centers in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia throughout the month of November.

Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon."
1052,Anne Holub,11/12/2017 10:00 AM,"When you?re job searching, it can feel like there are hundreds of applicants for every open position, but some companies are struggling to fill jobs. Business Insider noted over 263,000 open positions in tech, as of February 2017.  If companies could improve their pipeline of trained employees, they just might be able to hire the right person for the job, and retain them over the long-term as well. That?s just what apprenticeships could do ? if companies and lawmakers invest in them.

We?re not talking internships here. Apprenticeships by their nature are a different animal. Internships are often offered to undergraduate college students for a few weeks or months during summer or break, or sometimes for an hour or two during the school week. They are often unpaid, but generally offer school credit.  Apprenticeships, on the other hand, typically offer both training and pay. Apprenticeships in the U.S. were traditionally offered to train young workers for blue-collar jobs like plumbers or carpenters. The apprenticeships of the future could bring that idea of skilled technical training (and steady pay) to white-collar jobs in tech, banking and more."

A registered apprenticeship is an employer-driven model that combines on-the-job learning with classroom instruction while also allowing the apprentice to earn a paycheck from their very first day in the program. This is the time to find out why you should consider registered apprenticeships to help fill the talent gap caused by an aging workforce of highly-skilled and experienced workers and to draw in a new, more diverse talent pool.

But the careers that transform Michigan ? and the world ? are very different from even a few short years ago.  With more than 500,000 new private-sector jobs created since 2010, employers know that Michigan is a great place to locate and expand. But our work isn't done, and we need to help more people gain in-demand skills so they can fill rewarding jobs as we continue to grow our economy.

National Apprenticeship Week provides us the opportunity to highlight one of the many pathways to good jobs available here. Registered apprenticeship programs continue to be an effective way to grow Michiganders' paychecks and provide a sustainable, prosperous lifestyle.  Today, there are more than 900 registered apprenticeship programs in the Great Lakes State, with 14,000-plus apprentices, putting us in the top 10 in the nation for these training programs.  Make no mistake, these programs are beneficial to businesses, too. For every dollar spent, companies see a $1.50-plus return on their investment."
1056,Staff,11/12/2017 5:14 AM,"As I visit communities across Northwest Oregon, I hear from many Oregonians who feel left behind and left out of the economic recovery.

Too many people are still struggling to make ends meet.

They feel overwhelmed by rising rent prices, barriers to transportation, and sky-high childcare costs.

There may be job openings in their community, but the jobs require skills and resources they don't have.

More than half of the jobs in today's labor market require less than a four-year degree, but more than a high school diploma.

Only 43 percent of American workers have the skills for those positions.

This creates a ""Skills gap,"" leaving businesses struggling to find workers with necessary skills, and workers without pathways to better-paying jobs.

Apprenticeships and work-based learning programs help close the skills gap.

Employers can align training with the skills they need, and workers learn while they earn through classroom instruction and paid, on-the-job training.

We need to strengthen investments in work-based learning programs that respond to local industry needs, like the Oregon Manufacturing Innovation Center.

OMIC brings together industry leaders like Boeing with educational institutions such as Oregon Tech, Oregon State University, Portland State University, and Portland Community College to develop work-based learning programs.

This collaboration will result in growth and efficiency in advanced manufacturing, and more good jobs for Oregonians.

OMIC is the right approach, at the right time, in the right place.

It will foster the expertise and innovation that American industries need to continue to thrive and compete globally.

This public-private partnership is a tremendous opportunity for Oregonians because it brings value to our communities and the economy.

To help Oregonians and many other Americans who still face job insecurity, we must expand work-based learning to sectors of the economy that lack established apprenticeship programs, like health care and technology start-ups.

Small- and medium-sized businesses often do not have the resources to establish work-based learning programs.

Like OMIC, industry partnerships bring together employers, education institutions, training providers, and community-based organizations to support the creation and expansion of work-based learning programs that benefit workers and the economy as a whole.

Recently my colleague on the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Drew Ferguson, and I introduced bipartisan legislation to expand opportunities for skills training.

Our bill, the PARTNERS Act, would support industry partnerships to help small- and medium-sized businesses develop work-based learning programs-at no additional cost to taxpayers.

The industry partnerships will also make it easier for people to re-enter the workforce by providing workers with access to tools, work attire, transportation, child care services, and mentorship support.

Through greater investment in apprenticeships and other training programs, we can get more people back to work and provide our nation's businesses with a more productive and efficient workforce.

The PARTNERS Act and OMIC stem from the same good concept: when we approach economic problems with workers and businesses in mind, we come up with better solutions for everyone-and we all win."

These partnerships bring together unions and employers to recruit, train, and diversify the workforce for a given industry or a specific employer. The involvement of unions ensures employer training programs that benefit the company also benefit workers and their communities by creating pathways to family-sustaining careers.

In Washington, the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee (AJAC) brings together local labor, employers, community groups, educational institutions and local government to develop and fund cost-efficient training programs that respond to aerospace industry needs, create career opportunities for disadvantaged communities, and provide real paths for advancement for workers who invest their time and effort in training programs. For example, between 2014 and 2017 the AJAC served 717 apprentices, including 418 new apprentices enrolled in registered apprenticeship (RA) programs and in early 2017, launched the state?s first apprenticeship program for youth to enter the industry directly out of high school."

The mission of the Task Force, chaired by U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, is to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeship programs are insufficient. Bumphus will serve with experts from business, trade and industry groups, educational institutions and labor unions, working to address the nation?s skills gaps. The Task Force will submit a report to President Donald Trump detailing the strategies and proposals.

Bumphus said. ?As a leader in workforce education, community colleges play a pivotal role in the development of a strong pipeline of qualified workers.  The skills they learn at community college prepare them for high-wage jobs in competitive fields.

That message resonated clearly at a Monday afternoon event celebrating Apprenticeship Week in the State of Kansas, Nov. 13-19, with a proclamation from Gov. Sam Brownback honoring the role on-the-job training opportunities provide for Kansans and for the state?s workforce.  During an event at the Westar Energy Professional Development Center, 801 N.E.

Just over 100 of those apprentices work for Westar Energy, where director of safety and training Marc Welsh said they are ?critical? to the company, which benefits by maintaining a well-trained workforce. Like many industries, Westar is facing the retirement of workers throughout the company and needs to be on top of training the next generation of electrical workers.  ?The key is to try to stay ahead, because a large part of the success of our apprenticeship program hinges on having quality journeymen in the program they can learn from,? he said."

It's a celebration that offers leaders in business, labor, education, and other critical partners a chance to express their support for apprenticeships.  At NorthWest Arkansas Community College, we support apprenticeships with words and actions as we partner with others to provide important workforce training for individuals entering critical skilled trades.

An apprenticeship makes good economic sense for both the employer and the apprentice. According to Department of Labor statistics, workers who complete apprenticeship programs earn $300,000 more over a career than their peers who don't. Another statistic shows for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers get approximately $1.50 in return on investment.  Arkansas has 104 registered apprenticeship programs, involving hundreds of employers and approximately 5,000 registered apprentices, according to a National Apprenticeship Week proclamation issued by Gov. Asa Hutchinson."

Our apprenticeship program is the oldest certified journeyman program of its type in South Carolina.  It focused on tool and die makers when it began in 1988 but has since been expanded to include machinists, electrical-mechanical technicians and programming.  The company participated in a White House roundtable in March to share its success.

Over the years, we have recruited and trained 300 apprentices, who learn our way of doing business while they earn a two-year associates degree from the local technical college.

According to the Florida Chamber, while more than 400,000 are looking for jobs, we have 232,000 jobs looking for people.  Florida?s employers and workforce development, economic development and education entities are collaborating to bridge that gap with a new focus on apprenticeships.

The National Office of Apprenticeship, within the U.S. Department of Labor, has set a goal of doubling and diversifying the number of apprenticeships by 2019. Florida is among 36 states and Guam recently selected to help make that big goal a reality through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative.  The responsibility tied to these grants is clear: Build partnerships across key industries and organizations to create a strong talent pipeline for businesses in vital industries such as advanced manufacturing and information technology."
1072,Donald Norcross,11/14/2017  12:45 AM,"When I was a kid, I was always the one taking apart our bicycles just to see how they worked. I loved working with my hands. Many kids and teens today are probably just like me, but instead of helping these students develop trade skills, we instead dissuade them and push them toward a ""one-size-fits-all"" traditional four-year college.  An apprenticeship program shaped my life - taking me from construction work to Congress. Now, as a member of the House of Representatives, I'm fighting to raise wages for hardworking American families and make sure there's a seat at the table for everyone.  I received ""the other four-year degree."" I was an electrician's apprentice and then worked for years installing and restoring power for New Jersey homes, businesses and industrial sites.

When I was an apprentice, every spot in my program was spoken for - with a waiting list of hundreds more who wanted the same opportunity. Today, it concerns me to see a stigma surrounding apprenticeships in America. I also noticed it when first arrived in Congress. I found for some there was a lack of understanding about apprenticeships and the day-to-day needs of workers.  During this year's National Apprenticeship Week, let's start breaking down that stigma. We should remember that our country needs electricians and computer programmers, just like we need doctors and lawyers."

1074,David Salazar,11/14/2017  6:00 PM,"CVS Health is expanding the states participating in its apprenticeship program and set a new apprentice hiring goal. The company said it anticipates hiring 5,000 new apprentices by 2022 as it welcomes Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to its program, bringing its total number of statewide programs to 18.  CVS Health said that its registered apprenticeship programs offer participants structured training in such fields as pharmacy care and prescription benefit management while equipping them with a credential to help jump-start their careers.  ""Apprenticeships help job creators fill open positions with skilled job seekers,"" said Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta. ?CVS Health's goal to hire thousands more apprentices reflects the strength of the apprenticeship model. The Administration is pleased to see the creation of more opportunities for Americans to learn the skills they need to find family-sustaining jobs.?

Since it first began a registered apprenticeship program for pharmacy technicians in 2005, CVS Health said it has seen more than 4,700 people join in the retail pharmacy, prescription benefit management and retail store management tracks. As part of its apprenticeship efforts, CVS health works with community organizations to ensure a consistent pipeline of apprentices.

1075,Heather Swink,11/14/2017  9:00 AM,"Midsize manufacturers and supporting groups across the country are increasingly addressing workforce challenges through apprenticeships.  Thanks in part to financial assistance from government, private sources and businesses themselves, companies are adopting modern apprenticeship programs to remedy the supply and demand imbalance in manufacturing. These initiatives are increasing the pool of skilled workers and creating a pipeline of higher-quality talent in the trades.  ?Because apprenticeship training is so effective, we?re experiencing a renewal of apprenticeships in the United States,? says Charlotte Weber, director and CEO of the Robert C. Byrd Institute, which supports economic development in the mid-Atlantic region.

In 2015, RCBI received a $4.9 million award from the U.S. Department of Labor, as part of the American Apprenticeship Initiative, to expand its training model for technologically advanced manufacturing nationwide.  ?Industry and workers are benefitting equally from this proven method of closing the skills gap in today?s new manufacturing?a resurgent industry that continues to drive our economy,?

Pam Howze, the program director of Apprenticeship at National Fund for Workforce Solutions, is the scheduled keynote breakfast speaker. The breakfast begins at 8 a.m. in the center?s room 111.

The nationwide National Apprenticeship Week celebration kicked off Monday and is being held through Sunday.

1077,Gillian Branstetter,11/14/2017 1:34 PM,"As baby boomers retire and millennials dismiss the construction field, contractors and lobbyists are blaming state laws for restricting their ability to meet impending workforce shortages.

""We are in an industry that, to be quite honest, is in dire need of workers,"" said David Sload, president and CEO the Keystone Chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors.

""We're an aging workforce. If you look at over the next 2, 4, 6, 10 years and what we're going to lose in our industry, we don't have enough workers trained to fill the current roles that are needed, let alone what's going to happen as this industry continues to grow.""

One of the major hindrances to training new workers, said Sload, is Pennsylvania's apprenticeship ratios.

Under the state's 1961 Apprenticeship and Training Act, contractors working in the state must maintain four licensed journeyman on any job site for every individual apprentice.

While unions can negotiate a lower ratio in collective bargaining agreements, the vast majority of Pennsylvania contractors operating without union representation must abide by the rule in all bids for government work.

While proponents for the rule claim the higher rate of journeyman ensures job safety, those advocating for reform accuse union shops of protecting an archaic law in the interest of hurting open shops.

""We have to have four journeyman supervising one apprentice,"" says Jeff Georg, president of York-based ASCOM Electric.

""So I ask you, how practical is that? If you're a young person who just graduated high school and we take you on as an apprentice, you have four supervisors looking over your work. It's just not even feasible to have four people directly supervising an apprentice's work.""

Exemptions to the rule can be sought by independent contractors through applying to the state's Apprenticeship & Training Council.

According to council co-chair and president of Camp Hill-based construction firm Secco Inc. Barry Kindt, union forces from the state's urban centers are using the ratio rule to keep their own costs down while forcing non-union contractors to hire more workers and fewer apprentices - thereby putting them at a competitive disadvantage.

""They keep blocking anything to do with changing the apprenticeship ratios while, at the same time, they don't have to abide by the rule,"" said Kindt.

""Our surrounding states have lower ratios, but we have to follow our ratios. The other contractors can come from as far away as Colorado, so we have absolutely no chance of doing federal work in Pennsylvania if we abide by our ratios.""

""It makes the playing field very uneven for us,"" said Georg, ""And it's been this way for years and years. It's more than disconcerting.""

Pennsylvania is one of 25 states to enforce their own ratios over the one-to-one ratio offered by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, which governs the ratios of the other 25 states.

A bill introduced into the state House by Rep. Craig Staats would lower the state's ratio to match the federal one-to-one standard.

Mike Schurr, co-chair of the state's Apprenticeship & Training Council, rejects Kindt's suggestion that the ratios in Pennsylvania are tipping the competitive scales either way.

""I'm a 31-year member of DC-21, the International Union of Painters,"" said Schurr, ""And we have 4,000, 4,300 members on our council, and last count was 280 apprentices. So that's more than a 10-to-1 ratio. So the advantage unions were given through the way the laws were written, they certainly aren't using that advantage.""

Schurr and other advocates of the four-to-one ratio see the fight for reform as having less to do with workforce development and everything to do with competition for state projects.

""If you are in the construction business and you want to bid on public works projects, it triggers Pennsylvania's prevailing wage law,"" said Wanner, ""And that law sets up minimum wages that have to be paid. If you want to bid on this project with apprentices, you can pay apprentices a lower rate.""

According to Wanner, groups like ABC and IEC want to enforce a one-to-one ratio so they can stock their worksites with more apprentices instead of licensed journeyman who must be paid the prevailing wage rate based on local collective bargaining agreements.

The laws governing prevailing wage work allow for apprentices to be paid less than journeyman, said Wanner.

""I view it - and others view it - as a race to the bottom for lower wages,"" said Jon O'Brien, executive director of the Keystone Contractors Association.

""A lot of people who want the one-to-one would rather pay apprentices than journeyman.""

According to O'Brien, lowering the ratio could also raise safety concerns.

""There's a lot of education that goes into it, a lot of mentoring that goes into it. When you're trying to be productive and educate an apprentice, you can kind of lose focus.""

""I don't disagree with the open-shop guys about the need for more apprentices,"" said Wanner.

""But you don't want to do it to give somebody a competitive advantage or do it in such a way that safety would be compromised.""

""We have proven time and again that safety is as good or better with a one-to-one ratio versus more than one,"" said Kindt ""In this world, if more than one person is responsible, no one is responsible."""
1080,Clint Walker,11/14/2017 2:00 AM,"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) today marked the beginning of Apprenticeship Week 2017. This national celebration recognizes leaders across industry, education and government who support apprenticeships and help prepare our next generation of workers. National Apprenticeship Week stretches from November 13 to November 19.  ?Apprenticeship programs are a win-win for the Illinois economy,? said Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner. ?They deliver a pathway to good paying jobs and stable careers. Apprentices are given the skills and education necessary to maximize their potential. I am proud of the work we have done to invest in our workforce through apprenticeships, and I look forward to continuing to support these programs across our great state.?

Under the leadership of Governor Bruce Rauner, Illinois has made a concerted effort to increase and support apprenticeships throughout every industry. In July, the Department announced the locations of the initial Apprenticeship PLUS pilots under the Governor?s Cabinet for Children and Youth. The pilots specifically target both in-school and out-of-school youth between the ages of 16 and 24, and provide them with specific career education, a chance to earn industry-recognized credentials and on-the-job training."

""Recruiting and retaining highly talented individuals for the future workforce of America's rural water systems is vital as the industry underpins the agricultural economy and the lives of those living in rural America.""

It takes more than 380,000 highly skilled water and wastewater personnel to ensure the public supply of safe drinking water and to protect our lakes, streams and groundwater.

Advancements in water treatment and supply technology have increased the skills and training required of this workforce.

Water professionals are responsible for meeting stringent regulatory standards, replacing aging infrastructure, recruiting and training new operations specialists, and responding to and recovering from disasters.

In addition to increasing professional demands, utilities will soon be forced to replace many of their most experienced employees.

Over the next decade, the water sector is expected to lose between 30 and 50 percent of the workforce to retirement.

Many of these employees have worked at the same utility for the majority of their careers, and they will depart with decades of valuable institutional knowledge.

About NRWA. The National Rural Water Association is the largest public drinking water and sanitation utility organization representing the interests of more than 31,000 water and wastewater utilities nationwide.

NRWA provides training and technical assistance through 49 affiliated State Rural Water Associations dedicated to supporting and promoting the water and wastewater professionals that serve small communities across the United States.

NRWA and the State Affiliates provide training on operator certification, financial sustainability, environmental compliance, utility management and governance to over 80,000 water professionals annually in all 50 states.

1082,D,11/14/2017 5:45 PM,"After a generation of parents and schools telling graduating high school seniors a college education was the key to their futures, blue-collar jobs like manufacturing and skilled trades careers have taken a hit.

In the meantime, leadership in those career fields were lacking in marketing and recruitment techniques, which further limited the number of bodies entering those fields.

Thats all changing, much like the landscape of skilled trades.

In todays rapidly evolving high-tech society, the blue-collar, working-with-your-hands days of the past have merged with robotics and CNC programming to give birth to a new generation of skilled trades in which education is just as important as hands-on instruction.

Tuesday, 50 high school career placement professionals from throughout Macomb County took a daylong tour of skilled trades apprenticeship programs available in southeastern Michigan as part of National Apprenticeship Week.

The program is designed to help educators learn more about the advantages of a skilled construction trade career.

When I was a kid, we had all those vocational classes in our high schools.

Metal shop and wood shop, architectural, mechanical drawing, and today kids dont have that opportunity, so theyre not exposed to it like we were, Tom Mittelbrun of the National Electrical Contractors Association said.

Our touch plan, where we bring the high school kids and their parents to see what we do is a great demonstration for them so they can see if it is for them.

The school counselors started their day at the Detroit Electrical Industry Training Center on 11 Mile Road in Warren to talk with instructors about various electrical skilled trades available.

Jennifer Smith, an instructor at the DEITC, who talked to the counselors about cable splicing and power distribution, used to be a bank teller while on a slow path to a college degree when she heard about the apprentice program.

She quickly learned about the benefits of getting paid while adapting to a new career.

I just realized it was going to take a long time, a long struggle to get a degree, eight years going part time.

Then I would be starting at the bottom, so I said theres got to be something better, she said.

I learned about the skilled trades, applied to the electrical apprenticeship program for five years, and 18 years later, here I am today, an instructor.

College isnt for everybody, and with skilled trades, there is a big demand, Smith added.

If you like working with your hands, this is a good career.

Apprentices go out in the field on the days theyre not at school and work with a licensed journeyman and learn their craft.

The roadshow also took the counselors to the Sheet Metal Workers Local 80 Training Center in Warren, the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters Training Center in Ferndale, the Bricklayers Training Center in Warren and the Painters Training Center, also in Warren.

They came away impressed with the options available to graduating seniors.

I would love to bring students here to show them firsthand what is out there in industry.

It could really change their lives, Michelle VanVallis, a high school counselor at Eastpointe Community Schools said.

I can think of several students right now who would be a perfect fit for this program.

They allow the world of work and the world of school to connect; which ultimately fosters more meaningful and relevant conversations with students added Jennifer Case, Chippewa Valley Schools CTE/counselor.

Russell Davis, Michigan State Director for the United States Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship, said events like these help graduating seniors realize post secondary education is important, whether they decide to go to college or some other route.

Programs like this help the underprivileged, the diverse population, the students that dont want to go to college but still want to work with their hands, he said.

Weve got 15,300 apprentices in Michigan with close to 1,000 sponsors.

There were times when people didnt go to college and said Ill just be a construction worker or work in a factory.

Today, you must do 144 clock hours for every year of apprentice training.

These students will put a lot of time into these labs to take care of the preventative and planned maintenance out in the field.

So you cant just walk out of high school and be able to troubleshoot this stuff."
1083,Alyson Klein,11/14/2017 5:50 AM,"U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos told a meeting Monday that the country needs to quit trying to push every student to attend a four-year college, and open up apprenticeships and other workplace learning experiences to more students.

""We need to stop forcing kids into believing a traditional four-year degree is the only pathway to success,"" DeVos said at the first meeting of the White House Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion.

""We need to expand our thinking on what apprenticeships actually look like ... we need to start treating students as individuals ... not boxing them in.""

The panel, which was created through an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year, is chaired by Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta.

DeVos and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross serve as vice-chairs.

Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter and a White House adviser, was also on-hand.

The task force consists of business and education organizations, including representatives from the American Association of Community Colleges, the Association of Public and Land Grant Colleges, and the Business Roundtable.

There are also GOP governors on the task force, including Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, and Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa.

Acosta kicked off the session by talking about the yawning ""Skills gap."" The country, he said, has more than six million open jobs, but some employers can't find workers with the skills to fill them.

Later in the meeting, he mentioned that a company in Texas was looking to hire dozens of welders for jobs paying $65,000 a year, but couldn't find them.

Trump noted that, in Germany, about a third of workers go through some sort of apprenticeship program, so the idea ""Can be scaled.""

DeVos gave a shout-out to ""Earn + Learn,"" an apparent reference to a Detroit-based nonprofit that pairs educational training, including GED courses and reading, math, and computer courses, with financial coaching, and job training opportunities.

The Trump administration can use its ""Bully pulpit"" to advance career training, and help set up some incentives through the pending reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, DeVos said.

Most of the progress on job training will likely come from the private sector.

The task force, DeVos said, is about getting a chance to hear from the business community about how government can help businesses advance their career training goals-even if the answer is to get government of out of the way.

She expected, too, that many solutions would be ""Regional in nature.""

DeVos also recounted a conversation she had about when the ""Higher education bubble"" would burst.

She'd heard it suggested that some of the biggest employers in the country should band together and come up with their own solution for workforce training problems.

During a nearly two-hour discussion, some of the members echoed DeVos' sentiments.

Joseph Sellers, the general president of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers, noted that some guidance counselors feel they are judged on how many of their students enroll in college, so they are more likely to push students that way.

Acosta also wanted to know what the appetite is in higher education to make changes-whether colleges can move to certificate programs.

Walter G. Bumphus, the president and of CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges, said that colleges are ready to move forward.

He highlighted to separate partnerships between the City Colleges of Chicago and the consulting organization Accenture and Gateway Technical College in Kenosha, Wis., and Ocean Spray.

Accosta closed the meeting by saying that the panel would be putting together a guidance document on apprenticeships.

Company announces new goal during National Apprenticeship Week.

Expands Registered Apprenticeship programs across seven states.

PRNewswire/ - In an ongoing commitment to workforce development, CVS Health today announced it has set a goal of hiring 5,000 new apprentices by 2022.

The newly established goal, which coincides with the U.S. Department of Labor's National Apprenticeship Week, reflects an expansion of the company's Registered Apprenticeship program to seven additional states, including Arizona.

Bringing the total number of statewide apprenticeship programs supported by CVS Health to 18.

Registered Apprenticeships provide participants with structured training to maintain the high level of skills needed in complex fields such as pharmacy care and prescription benefit management, and equips participants with a nationally recognized credential that will help them advance in their careers.

""Apprenticeships help job creators fill open positions with skilled job seekers,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta.

""CVS Health's goal to hire thousands more apprentices reflects the strength of the apprenticeship model. The Administration is pleased to see the creation of more opportunities for Americans to learn the skills they need to find family-sustaining jobs.""

CVS Health became the first employer to launch a U.S. Department of Labor Registered Apprenticeship program for pharmacy technicians in 2005.

Through 2017, the company has had more than 4,700 colleagues join its Registered Apprenticeship career tracks for retail pharmacy, prescription benefit management and retail store management.

CVS Health is among a growing number of U.S. companies investing in earn-and-learn apprenticeship programs, due in part to the nation's skills gap.

Today, there are more than 6 million vacant jobs that American workers are unable to fill-the highest level on record, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The BLS also reported in 2015 that the country is projected to produce one million fewer technical workers than is needed over the next decade.

""The widening skills gap in the U.S. is a significant business concern, and companies - large and small - are seeing this workplace strategy that combines on-the-job training with classroom instruction as a viable solution to build a pipeline of future skilled talent,"" said Lisa Bisaccia.

As part of its apprenticeship strategy, CVS Health works with community organizations across the country to source a consistent pipeline of apprentices including federal, state and local government organizations, public workforce agencies, community colleges, community-based nonprofits and faith-based organizations to provide candidate referrals from untapped pools of talent.

""Meaningful work and a defined career track can provide a source of dignity, pride and identity, which participants are able to gain through our Registered Apprenticeship programs,"" added Bisaccia.

As the third annual National Apprenticeship Week, a nationwide opportunity for companies, trade and industry groups, nonprofit organizations, unions, labor-management organizations, and educational institutions to highlight how apprenticeships prepare American workers for the jobs of today and the future.

1092,Kathryn Moody,11/15/2017  10:00 AM,"The Trump administration is a vocal supporter of apprenticeship programs, even accepting the challenge posed by Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff to create 5 million apprenticeships in five years.  Some experts say that apprenticeships could be the link between employers with millions of job openings, and the millions of job seekers looking for work. But how do you make 5 million high-quality apprenticeships actually happen? That was the focus of Tuesday's Third Annual Transatlantic Apprenticeship Exchange Forum at the Urban Institute.  Panelists and experts from the public and private sectors discussed potential solutions for employers, as well as what the U.S. can learn from the successes and failures of similar programs that took off in the late 90s in the U.K.  Central to the implementation of apprenticeships in the U.S. are three practical questions related to future scalability.

A contentious point remains for employers, employees and the government: apprenticeships are expensive. They are the ""Cadillac"" of training, the gold standard by which many programs are evaluated, said Tamar Jacoby, president and CEO of Opportunity America. But the costs are heavy, including training fees and payroll for working apprentices.  There is little consensus currently on the level of government involvement required for such programs. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta stated during the first meeting of the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) apprenticeship task force that the current apprenticeship program ""does not work,"" Politico reported. His DOL wants to put businesses and business groups in ?the driver?s seat? (a common phrase used at the forum) of apprenticeship creation and oversight, rather than the government."
1095,Staff Report,11/15/2017  11:42 AM,"During National Apprenticeship Week, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today pressed President Trump?s Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion to identify programs and policies that will help ensure our nation?s most at-risk youth have access to pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship opportunities. In a letter to Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, Chair of the President?s Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, Durbin urged him to prioritize identifying strategies to increase apprenticeship opportunities for youth in underserved communities who may not currently have access to these programs as the task force prepares its report for the President on strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships.  ?Nothing stops a bullet like a job. It is imperative that the federal government build on the success of Chicago and other cities by expanding access to job training, including apprenticeships. These programs give young people the opportunity to escape a vicious cycle of poverty and violence,? Durbin wrote. ?I encourage all members of the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion to give serious thought to how apprenticeships can serve youth in communities that are faced with chronic unemployment and high rates of violent crime.?

Secretary Acosta and other Administration officials have often voiced support for apprenticeship programs as a means to improve skills development and prepare youth for the workforce. At the same time, President Trump?s Fiscal Year 2018 budget proposed cutting federal job training programs by 40 percent. The President has also asked agencies to recommend workforce development programs for elimination. These proposals could have a serious impact on at-risk youth who rely on federally funded employment programs.  Youth who are out-of-school and out-of-work have lower lifetime earnings, face higher rates of poverty, and are more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system than youth who are employed. Across the country, Americans who live in communities with concentrated poverty and unemployment are also more likely to become victims of violent crime.

The apprenticeships are a collaboration among the Charleston Regional Youth Apprenticeship Program, the Labor Department and Project Lead the Way Inc., an Indianapolis-based nonprofit that provides science, technology, engineering and math curricula to schools.  ?We are so thrilled to be part of this national project with Project Lead the Way and the U.S. Department of Labor,? said Mary Thornley, president of Trident Technical College, one of the Charleston Regional Youth Apprenticeships partners.

Project Lead the Way has curricula in several schools in the tri-county region, and the new partnership allows high school students who are taking engineering courses in ninth and 10th grades to apply for youth apprenticeships with Boeing, Bosch, Thomas and Hutton, Mobile Communications and Charleston County.  Melissa Stowasser, dean of school and community initiatives at Trident Tech, said companies will begin hiring youth apprentices in the spring and the apprenticeships will start next fall.  ?Efforts here in Charleston, along with the support from local businesses, the (Charleston Metro) Chamber of Commerce and great implementations of PLTW in local schools make this the perfect location to begin this collaborative work,? said Glade Montgomery, senior vice president of partnerships at Project Lead the Way."

Wire-Net's Apprenticeship Consortium is serving as the apprenticeship sponsor for Max Hayes's pre-apprenticeship program.  ""Many of the firms with which we are developing apprenticeships in CNC machining do not have internal candidates for the apprenticeship, so getting more precision and CNC machining programs in the region to train high school pre-apprentices makes sense,"" Michael Hoag, WIRE-Net's vice president for workforce programs, said in the release."
1107,Lolade Fadulu,11/15/2017 3:52 PM,"When asked about Donald Trump's June 2017 executive order calling for the expansion of apprenticeships, Anthony Carnevale says it's just ""Good PR."".

Carnevale-the research professor and director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce-believes the high costs of apprenticeships and the U.S.'s dark past with job training will stymie the effort, which aims to help people find jobs in an economy that is rapidly changing primarily because of technological advances.

The U.S. has never gotten job training and retraining right.

Successful apprenticeship programs aren't impossible.

The apprenticeship model thrives in European countries such as Germany, partly because wages vary less across industries than they do in the U.S. In the U.S., apprenticeship programs are difficult to institutionalize because employees are more likely than their European counterparts to leave a job for a different one that offers better wages.

There was a concern among economists that we'd all end up with what people used to call ""McJobs"": low-wage service jobs.

It turned out that the truth was technology was going to kill off a lot of jobs, and it was going to create a lot more jobs.

Fadulu: What else, in addition to the executive order on apprenticeships, should the Trump administration do to prepare people for the changing economy?

Carnevale: Apprenticeship is a bright and shiny object.

The [first] problem with apprenticeships in the U.S. is we can't do much job training before the end of high school because if we do, we will end up putting African Americans, Latinos, working class, and poor kids into those programs and the rich white kids will go to college.

Politically, we're unable to do job training in the K-12 system, so it has to start after high school.

We've mostly done it through a postsecondary-education and training system, which is mostly two-year and four-year schools-technical institutes.

2 problem is that an apprenticeship in manufacturing and any technical field costs anywhere from $60,000 to $260,000.

States and the federal government are about to give employers tax breaks to have them do apprenticeships, but they aren't going to give them $260,000 dollars.

We all went to Europe to see apprenticeship because the minute you start seeing unemployment, the Europeans always look good.

Everybody's happy; people like apprenticeships.

We all came back and said, ""Okay, we're going to have an program."" promised apprenticeship in the campaign for his first term.

By the time we got elected employers and labor unions came to us and said, ""You can do whatever you want but don't call it 'apprenticeship.'"" We don't want the government fooling around with 'apprenticeship.

So we took off the word ""apprenticeship"" and it became something called School to Work, which we passed and funded at $500 million.

The public wanted nothing to do with it because if I go to any middle-class school in America, any high school, and say, ""You know, Johnny and Mary, they're not doing so good in this academic thing that's going to send them to college.

Those advantaged kids go to college, graduate, get good jobs, marry each other, move into neighborhoods with good schools and with neighbors who look just like them, and the cycle continues.

They then to go work in low-wage jobs, marry people who look like them, and move into neighborhoods with the weakest public schools, and the cycle continues.

In America, and I can tell you this, if you're a politician and you stand in front of a crowd and say, ""We're gonna have vocational training in high school,"" every parent in that room is gonna be saying, ""I'll be damned if you're going to put my kid in that because my kid's going to college.

Fadulu: Why didn't people want the word ""apprenticeship"" used in the name of the program?

Carnevale: In those days, business people associated the word ""apprenticeship"" with unions.

The unions also didn't want the word ""apprenticeship"" because they didn't want the government to have any control over apprenticeship.

Carnevale: Technical jobs, where there's a lot of learning on the job.

Most of them tend to require that you get some education after high school before you can get into them.

Those technical jobs might be impacted by automation.

So even if you do have apprenticeships where people are guaranteed work, there's still the possibility that those jobs can be automated and those people will lose the job.

Technical jobs are-especially at the level, but even at the level- some of the best paid with the exception of graduate-level professional jobs like [doctors].

We shifted from training during the Clinton administration, which decided, during the second term, that training wasn't working.

Promising training doesn't get you any votes because people always think training is for somebody who either failed or is for somebody else's kid.

We spend $8 billion a year on training, compared to $500 billion on higher education.

They very quickly built out things like apprenticeships, job guarantees, employment guarantees, [and] three-to-five-year unemployment insurance.

The U.S. did do training at one point after WWII when we believed that only about 15 percent of high-school kids needed to go to college.

Now, all U.S. students get an academic education through high school, and there really is no vocational prep in high school anymore.

We end up with no training in high school but have turned to higher education to do more workforce development.

The training budget in the U.S. government is $8 billion, and the government and families spend over $500 billion dollars on college education.

The model in America is ""high school to Harvard."

Leaders across the country are highlighting the benefits of apprenticeships and the need for more students to join the trades.  Statistics on the need for a trained workforce are overwhelming ? in the United States, there will be 6.1 million jobs in the construction industry by 2021 and 1.5 million craft professionals will be needed to fill them. Skilled craft positions remain the hardest job to fill in the U.S. and globally. In Iowa, we are hearing the same message ? employers across the state routinely say it?s hard to hire enough skilled workers. 

At Associated Builders and Contractors of Iowa, we are working to train more apprentices than ever before to help close the skills gap. As the largest apprenticeship organization in Iowa, this year we will train roughly 1,500 apprentices across our three campuses in Grimes, Hiawatha and Davenport.  Our students are taught proper safety courses and specific skills in the areas of electrical, plumbing, HVAC, sheet metal, millwright, insulation, laborer and electronic systems technicians. Students graduate from our programs having real work experience, no educational debt, a job, and more important, a highly sought-after skill."
1111,Kathleen McLaughlin,11/15/2017 5:31 PM," A one-year apprenticeship program that encourages women, minorities and veterans to work in technology is launching in Central Oregon.  The Technology Association of Oregon hopes to begin training the first 10 to 12 people in software development in February, said Teri Hockett, Central Oregon coordinator for the technology association. The program, created by Apprenti in Seattle, is supported by federal and state grants and participating companies, which agree to accept apprentices and pay them 60 percent of the average local wage.  ?We have a huge gap in our pipeline, especially for technology workers,? Hockett said.

Apprenti aims to increase diversity in the technology industry while also addressing a labor shortage. The U.S. Department of Labor predicts there will be more than 1.3 million new programming and computer support specialist jobs by 2022, and Apprenti notes, less than 20 percent of the tech workforce is female, less than 5 percent is Hispanic or African-American, and the veteran population is even smaller.  The Washington Technology Industry Association Workforce Institute, a not-for-profit organization, created Apprenti. It?s expanding to other states with the help of local organizations and a $7.5 million ApprenticeshipUSA contract from the U.S. Department of Labor. Apprenti announced Tuesday that it?s expanding into Oregon, Michigan, California and Ohio.

The DOL is on the front line of the issues facing the national economy, employment growth and retirement security, noted Education and the Workforce Committee Chair Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. Whether discussing health care worker protections, retirement planning, workforce development, or employee wages and benefits, it is the committee's responsibility to ensure related policies are in the best interest of workers, employers and taxpayers, she added.  Acosta discussed a number of those issues at the Nov.15 hearing, including the status of a potential new overtime rule, apprenticeship programs and association health plans.  Here are some of the key points he made.

Overtime Rule - There has been a lot of talk in the HR community about what will happen with the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime-exempt salary threshold for white-collar workers. The Obama administration sought to raise the threshold to $47,476, but a federal judge in Texas said the rule is invalid. For now, the 2004 threshold of $23,660 remains?which Acosta has said is too low.

Apprenticeship Programs - This week is the DOL's third annual National Apprenticeship Week, which offers business leaders and other critical partners a chance to express their support for apprenticeships, according to the department's website.

Who better than electrical apprentices and master electricians to design the newest float in the upcoming annual Parade of Lights.

The Newest Addition to the 9NEWS Parade of Lights is something to behold.

The Sparkling Ice Castle of the Future is something to behold.

This week, in honor of National Apprenticeship Week, the Independent Electrical Contractors Rocky Mountain chapter conceived and built the newest float addition for the 9NEWS Parade of Lights debuting in Denver on December 1 and 2.

Who better than electrical apprentices and master electricians to design the newest float in the upcoming annual Parade of Lights? The float was unveiled yesterday as part of IEC's National Apprenticeship Week observance.

The Parade of Lights is presented by American Furniture Warehouse and produced by the Downtown Denver Partnership.

The new float highlights state-of-the-art lighting features and utilizes fiber optics and computer-programmed LED lighting not seen before in the parade.

The new float will make its inaugural appearance on Friday, December 1 and Saturday, December 2 in the 2017 9NEWS Parade of Lights.

""IECRM's float celebrates the hard work of the men and women in the electrical and renewable energy industry,"" says IECRM CEO Marilyn Akers Stansbury.

""This newest addition to the 9NEWS Parade of Lights illuminates the importance of skilled trade workers to our economy and communities, and shines the light on skilled trades as a viable and sustainable career path for our future generations.""

IECRM held a design contest and offered its students, members, and industry partners the opportunity to involve its apprentices and be a part of this unique experience.

The winning float design was selected by a panel of judges comprised of employees of the Downtown Denver Partnership and the IECRM Board of Directors.

The final float concept presents a splendid array of LED lighting, wiring, fiber optics, and design applications to create the Sparkling Ice Castle of the Future - a dreamy winter scene of brilliance and wonder, utilizing state-of-the-art and energy-efficient lighting features.

""Who better than an electrical trade association and an electrical trade school to come up with a bright idea and bring it to fruition to illuminate the wintery streets of Denver for the Parade of Lights?"" Stansbury added.

A volunteer team comprised of electricians, apprentices, and industry professionals are constructing the float using the most cutting edge LED lighting provided by IECRM industry partners.

""We hope that our float captures the attention of many men, women, minorities, and military veterans who are looking for a rewarding career,"" says IECRM Training Director Paul Lingo.

""It's a really great way for us to portray a career in electrical contracting and renewable energy in a fun and imaginative way.""

As many sectors in the U.S. economy grapple with a shortage of skilled workers, there's a growing opportunity for young job seekers or those looking for a new career.

The IECRM hosts hiring initiatives and is increasing its communications along the Front Range offering training and job placement in the electrical contracting field.

Electrical jobs are expected to be in high demand over the next decade.

Colorado's building boom in homes and businesses up and down the Front Range continues to require more wiring, electrical power, and systems automation including communications, lighting, and control systems.

Employment opportunities for electricians are growing faster than the average for all occupations in the U.S. A sustainable career, lifelong learning, and a living wage for electricians are attainable, and IECRM's training provides job skills that will last a lifetime while simultaneously increasing the supply of electricians.

The Sparkling Ice Castle of the Future float was designed and built by the Independent Electrical Contractors Association and Apprenticeship Training Program to illuminate the hard work of the men and women in the electrical and renewable energy industry, to highlight the importance of skilled trade workers to our economy and communities, and shine the light on skilled trades as a viable and sustainable career path for our future generations.

ColoradoElectricians.com In light of the recent natural disasters in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, electricians stand shoulder-to-shoulder with disaster first-responders working rapidly and diligently to restore power to affected communities.

While the severe shortage of electricians impacts these tragic situations, it also can cause the slowdown of construction overall.

If there is no means to build a structure's electrical nervous system, that structure cannot be started in many instances, and it certainly cannot be completed.

About IECRM. IECRM is a trade association for the electrical contracting and renewable energy industry serving Colorado and Wyoming.

It represents more than 200 member companies and educates more than 1600 electrical apprentices and licensed electricians annually through its Apprenticeship Training Program.

Now CVS, following a national trend, wants to use a similar model to train pharmacy techs in Pennsylvania.  In other states, CVS?s pharmacy tech apprenticeship programs have cut turnover, crucial in a tightening labor market.  It sounds promising to Colleen Orr, a nurse who teaches health and pharmacy technology at Kensington Health Sciences Academy, a public school whose students live mostly in poverty.  ?My kids, if they continue with this program, it?ll change their lives,? said Orr.

On Wednesday, her students made a field trip to the Philadelphia Job Corps Life Science Institute, where they learned, just in time for National Apprenticeship Week, about the new job-learning program offered by their school, the Job Corps, and CVS to create pharmacy technicians.  Pharmacy techs can earn up to $60,000 a year at the most advanced level, Stephanie Gambone, executive vice president of the Philadelphia Youth Network, told the students Wednesday.

On Oct. 27, the school district purchased Bubba's Diner, 841 Broad St., and the adjoining lot, formerly the site of Central Park fast-food restaurant, for $890,000 with special one-time funding from the state Legislature in partnership with the state Technical College System and Central Carolina Technical College.

If the district's construction plan comes to fruition, the new school will be next to Central Carolina's state-of-the-art Advanced Manufacturing Technology Training Center, 853 Broad St., which opened in August 2015.

Last year, the district also purchased other commercial property lots in two strip plazas near CCTC's training center with state funding.

One plaza strip adjoins CCTC's facility on the right, and the second runs perpendicular to the first.

Kevin Johnson, BD plant manager and chairman of Greater Sumter Chamber of Commerce's Industrial Association, said coming from his position as a manufacturing plant manager, any stronger link between a technical high school and Central Carolina is good news.

Sumter has long been known as an industrial community with a relatively high concentration of jobs in the manufacturing sector, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""It's exciting for us as a manufacturer,"" Johnson said.

""If we can continue to feed students into technical college programs and make them 'technical ready' for our jobs in the industry, it's only going to grow this community. It seems potentially like a wonderful feeder program.""

Brian Rauschenbach, project manager with the Sumter Economic Development Board staff, said having close proximity for a technical high school with a technical college or a manufacturer is a growing trend in the state.

Before joining the Sumter Development Board staff, Rauschenbach worked for Apprenticeship Carolina, a division of the state Technical College System, where he helped develop youth apprenticeship programs across the Palmetto State.

He said the concept builds brand awareness for the technical college and emphasizes the need for post-secondary education beyond the high school level for today's higher-skilled manufacturing jobs.

""Kids today need more than a high school diploma to be successful,"" Rauschenbach said.

""They need some type of technical skill via a certificate program or an associate degree from postsecondary education. It's the training of the future.""

He said the concept can set a solid path for students who want to pursue a manufacturing career with solid pay and benefits.

State Rep. Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, echoed those sentiments and pointed to Kershaw County - just north of Sumter County - with a public school district currently building a new technical high school next to Central Carolina's sub-campus off Interstate 20 near Camden.

CCTC serves the four-county region of Sumter, Kershaw, Lee and Clarendon, and it expanded its coverage in Kershaw within the last decade by building the new sub-campus.

Building more linkages to the technical college is critical for Sumter and surrounding counties to satisfy the growing workforce needs of business and industry.

""We have to grow our workforce as a community,"" Smith said.

""Business and industry here need qualified employees and individuals who are already trained and ready to enter the workforce. And this concept - we need to follow it. It's working in other areas of the state, and it's time for us to implement it in our region.""

School district officials have said previously that University of South Carolina Sumter and Morris College could also have a role in the new school, but because the school is still in its early stages, those plans have not yet been fleshed out."
1122,Editorial,11/16/2017 7:00 PM,"We often discuss the importance of postsecondary education on this page. From the 71 percent of Kansas jobs that will require some education beyond high school by 2020 to the larger share of high-paying jobs that are calling for applicants with bachelor?s degrees nationwide, it?s clear that higher education is increasingly vital in today?s economy. However, we also have to remember that there?s a vast range of educational options available ? something that should be particularly clear as Americans celebrate the third annual National Apprenticeship Week. 

?Apprenticeship? is a word that might sound antiquated to some people, perhaps calling to mind a young blacksmith or chimney sweep in the 19th or early 20th century. But in 2017, it refers to dynamic educational programs (in fields ranging from information technology to human resources to manufacturing to health care) that prepare young Americans for reliable, high-paying jobs. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, more than 90 percent of apprentices receive job offers when they finish their training, and they earn an average of $60,000 per year.  These are just a few of the reasons why Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump have prioritized the establishment of more apprenticeships in the U.S. "

PRNewswire/ - Apprentiu2122, the nation's first registered tech apprenticeship program, announced today that it will expand nationally into Oregon.

The apprenticeship program - which was started by the Washington Technology Industry Association in 2016 - recruits, trains and places diverse talent into tech roles.

According to a forecast by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be a surge of over 1.3 million new computer programming and computer support specialist jobs by 2022.

Companies are struggling to increase diversity within their workforce.

Less than 20 percent of the tech workforce is female, less than 5 percent is Hispanic or African American, and there are even fewer veterans.

Apprenti fills a critical role by closing the tech talent gap and providing opportunities for underrepresented groups to secure careers in tech.

""We're seeing two big problems emerging in the tech industry: Companies are having a difficult time finding the right talent to fill jobs, and diversity is sorely lacking. Apprenti changes both in a big way,"" said Jennifer Carlson.

""By expanding our presence into four new states, not only are we training and placing more diverse talent into local tech jobs, but also creating a national model for registered apprenticeship. Today's announcement is just the beginning as we expand our program to more states in the coming year.""

The expansion - the result of a $7.5 million ApprenticeshipUSA contract - follows Apprenti's successful Washington state.

Pilot program, which received more than 3,000 applicants and placed nearly 100 apprentices into tech positions since its launch one year ago.

Apprentices currently work in jobs at Amazon, Microsoft, Avvo, Comtech, F5 Networks and Silicon Mechanics, earning at least $42,000.

The jobs include web developer, software developer, network security administrator, Windows system administrator, Linux system administrator, cloud support specialist, data center technician and IT support professional.

""Information technology skills building is increasingly important to employers in many in-demand industries in Michigan.,"" said Michele Economou Ureste.

Executive director at the Workforce Intelligence Network, Apprenti's local expansion partner in Michigan.

""The Apprenti program is a proven and reliable pathway for underrepresented groups to gain training, certifications and job placement. This aligns with WIN's ongoing efforts to help employers with workforce development solutions to close the skills gap.""

Recognizes the need for tech talent and is implementing Apprenti in two different regions.

Partnering with Lane Workforce Partnership in the greater Eugene.

Area, Apprenti will be welcomed to the growing industry, which currently has 453 tech companies.

""With central Oregon. experiencing one of the fastest-growing job markets in the country, we need innovative ways to recruit, train and place top talent into tech roles. Apprenti's proven model offers an innovative solution to help us meet this demand,"" said Heather Ficht.

""We look forward to working with Apprenti to help our local tech companies find and develop the talent they need to thrive.""

Once accepted into the Apprenti program, apprentices receive between 14-20 weeks of certified technical training followed by one year of full-time, paid, on-the-job training with one of the hiring partners.

As a hybrid competency and time-based program, those with a strong determination to complete the rigorous training are encouraged to apply.

To be considered for the program, applicants must be 18 or over, have a high school diploma or equivalent and be eligible to work in the U.S. ""We've seen first-hand how Apprenti provides a pathway to well-paying jobs in the technology industry and are eager to help support the program as it launches into new states,"" said Sarah Steinberg.

Vice president of Global Philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase, one of Apprenti's funding partners.

""In this economy, technology skills are imperative to every company, and our hope is to improve access to living-wage job opportunities for workers who are currently under-represented in technology roles.""

Apprenti is a registered apprenticeship program powered by the Washington Technology Industry Association.

Apprenti trains future tech workers with an emphasis on underrepresented groups including women, minorities and veterans.

Apprenti is an industry recognized, state and federally accredited program.

Apprentices receive two to five months of full-time, industry recognized training before beginning one-year of paid on-the-job training with one of the program's hiring partners.

The program is partially funded through a U.S. Department of Labor ApprenticeshipUSA contract and a grant from the American Apprenticeship Initiative, with support from the Washington State."
1124,Meredith Cohn,11/17/2017 1:12 PM,"Maryland lost 5,500 jobs in October though the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8 percent, the U.S. Labor Department reported Friday.

The jobless rate remained below the national average of 4.1 percent, which ticked down from 4.2 percent in September as the employment picture improved in 12 states.

A ""Longer lens"" shows that the Maryland economy has been performing well, said Andy Bauer, a senior regional economist in the Baltimore branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

The state joins 26 others in adding a statistically significant number of jobs in the past year.

The state has gained 54,400 jobs, up 2 percent year-over-year, far off-setting the one-month loss.

""To me it does not signal any change in the underlying unemployment market in Maryland,"" Bauer said.

""You see 2 percent growth in Maryland year over year and that's considerably more than you're seeing at the national level.""

He said the gains and losses were inconsistent among sectors, but there were likely to be more additions than cuts going forward, particularly in the areas of IT, cyber-secruity and health, provided there are employees to fill the jobs.

It was too soon to tell what impact ongoing budget and tax negotiations in Washington would have in the state.

Among the sectors gaining jobs, education and health services added the most with 1,500 positions.

500 jobs were added in construction and 200 were added in manufacturing.

The biggest job losses were in the trade, transportation and utilities sector, followed by professional and business services; financial services; and leisure and hospitality.

The state has added 125,500 jobs since January 2015 and the unemployment rate is at a nine-year low, noted Kelly M. Schulz, Maryland labor secretary.

""The Hogan administration is committed to strengthening Maryland's economy,"" she said.

""The Department of Labor is fulfilling that commitment through innovative workforce solutions, like the Maryland Apprenticeship and Training Program."""
1125,Russell Redding,11/17/2017 11:48 AM,"November is a time to enjoy the year's harvest and reflect on our accomplishments.

It's also time to plan what comes next, assessing what we have and what we need - not just to stay afloat, but to grow as producers, as businesses and as an industry.

Since Gov. Tom Wolf took office in 2015, we have heard one consistent refrain from agricultural leaders around the state: We need a skilled and adaptable workforce to ensure our growth and prosperity.

Nearly half a million Pennsylvania jobs are in agriculture today - spanning the farms and forests of Pennsylvania and delivering food and fiber to each of us.

If you include retail food service, the number climbs above 917,000 jobs.

In the next decade, we expect more than 75,000 new and replacement job openings in the agriculture and food industry, and its supply and distribution chains.

We are undoubtedly a growth industry, but sustaining that growth will require recruiting, training and retaining far more skilled and dedicated workers than we currently have.

Early in the process of developing a strategic plan for the next decade of Pennsylvania's agriculture industry, the department conducted a workforce needs assessment, identifying 28 occupations that will be most in demand by the agriculture and food industry over the next decade.

One example - an occupation in which Pennsylvania will have 1,000 job openings in 2027 - is farm equipment mechanics and service technicians.

Roughly 997 farm equipment mechanics and service technicians currently work in the state, but many of these skilled workers are expected to retire during the next decade.

Producers have been telling us of the costly delays they face in getting their equipment repaired.

To address this shortage, last month, along with the state's Department of Labor & Industry, we launched the Agriculture Equipment Service Technician Apprenticeship to train more than 1,000 Pennsylvanians to repair and maintain electronics, global positioning and information systems, and other emerging technologies.

This first-of-its kind program will serve as a model for other states experiencing shortages of well-trained agriculture, industrial and outdoor power equipment technicians.

The Northeast Equipment Dealers Association sponsors the program, which will require at least one year to complete.

Five of our leading equipment companies - manufacturer New Holland Agriculture, and equipment dealers Binkley & Hurst, Deer Country Farm & Lawn, Hoober Inc., and Messick's Farm Equipment - have agreed to hire and provide mentors to train apprentices.

Mentors will ensure that classroom training is applied on the job.

Apprentices will earn pay increases as they pass learning milestones during 400 hours of classroom instruction and approximately 4,000 hours of on-the-job training.

Students must demonstrate mastery of skills ranging from interpersonal communication and critical thinking, to material fabrication and welding, and engine and machinery systems.

Apprentices who successfully complete the program will receive U.S. Department of Labor journeyman certification without the time and debt of a formal college education.

Registered apprenticeships offer a diverse group of nontraditional students a framework for hands-on learning in high-demand sectors of the economy.

Apprenticeships provide access for women, minorities and military veterans who might not have considered these opportunities in the past.

The program includes a pre-apprenticeship option for FFA students in programs that offer agriculture mechanics and supervised agriculture experience opportunities.

Pre-apprenticeship credit may be applied to either the classroom or on-the-job training portion of the apprenticeship.

The Steinman Foundation generously provided seed money to develop the apprenticeship program, and the Conservation Foundation of Lancaster County will provide fiduciary services.

In addition to entry-level career opportunities, program developers hope to collaborate with post-secondary institutions to create certificate and degree programs for agricultural engineering.

Our industry has career options to suit a broad and diverse range of interests, skills and educational levels.

This apprenticeship is just one tactic in a multipronged approach to building the workforce we need in coming years.

Working together, I am confident we can attract new people to our industry and keep it growing.

It is this kind of strategic thinking along with partnerships linking public and private entities that will empower us to realize our potential as not just a national but as a world leader in agriculture.

Russell Redding is Pennsylvania's secretary of agriculture."

Schaffler: Congressman, what are some of the misconceptions about working in the skill trades and how does National Apprenticeship Week change that?

Norcross: Well, each year we take a week out of our calendar to show, quite frankly, how our country came to be in terms of its employment working. Apprenticeships have been around since the turn of the century in the United States, but they were around in medieval times, handing down to the next generation a craft that could take care of your family and yourself.

1132,Alastair Fitzpayne,11/17/2017 5:00 PM,"With everyone in Washington focused on tax reform, you may have missed that this week is National Apprenticeship Week. Apprenticeships continue to receive increased attention from policymakers as they can give workers access to hands-on training for middle-skill jobs. Middle-skill jobs ? those which require education beyond high school but not a four-year degree ? make up the largest part of the labor market in all 50 states. And these programs aren?t just valuable in helping employers fill jobs.  Workers who complete apprenticeship programs earn up to $300,000 more over the course of their career. So it?s no surprise that both President Obama and President Trump have proposed expanding the number of apprenticeships.

As technology and automation continue to transform what the future of work looks like, skills development today is increasingly important. While we?ve seen bipartisan support for the apprenticeship model, the opportunities for skill building in the U.S. remain relatively limited. Today, there are more than 545,000 apprentices across the U.S. in more than 1,000 occupations.  The overwhelming majority of these apprentices are in the construction trades, followed by the manufacturing industry. Yet relative to other countries, like Germany, a very small share of workers obtain work through apprenticeship programs. At this point, despite the benefit to companies and workers alike, only a handful of industries actively use apprenticeship programs here in the U.S. This may be in part because apprenticeship programs can be costly to administer. According to a recent report from the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University, employers spend $47 billion on certification and apprenticeships."

What?s promising about apprenticeship is that participants don?t have to go into debt while getting trained for the workforce. Unlike college, apprentices learn while they earn. What?s more, 87 percent of participants finish their programs having already secured a job. Apprenticeships are, in turn, being touted as a simple fix to the country?s $1.3 trillion student-debt crisis and the high percentage of unemployed college graduates.  But $95 million is, according to Campa-Najjar, just a ?drop in the bucket.? European countries, such as Germany and Switzerland, invest billions in apprenticeship.

The increased emphasis coincides with the Trump administration's growing focus on apprenticeships, which included the inaugural convening of the President's Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion November 13.

The day after the president's task force convened, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos called for a ""major shift"" in higher education that would include a greater emphasis on apprenticeship programs at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council conference in Washington. DeVos said ""we have stigmatized"" career and technical education programs for years, when in reality, many students could benefit from such programs ? and so could the workforce.  Neither higher education nor the workforce can afford to continue operating in silos. Community colleges have traditionally had stronger ties to the workforce, and the renewed interest from the White House provides an opportunity for four-year institutions to be more forward-looking about the ways they collaborate with industry to provide a more diverse, better qualified pool of candidates. If private industry could better trust colleges and universities to prepare graduates with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce, higher ed would face fewer attacks on relevance and ROI.

Participating companies are to be commended, and expansion of such programs well beyond the traditional trades model is economically vital, Gov. Bruce Rauner said at a National and Illinois Apprenticeship Week celebration today at Chicago?s Aon Center.  ?There is no one-size-fits-all way to a career,? Rauner said. ?Here in Illinois, we are expanding our understanding of career pathways to include learn-and-earn models. Increasing our support for apprenticeships is just one of the ways Illinois is working to advance our world-class workforce.?

Aon and Accenture hosted the event, which celebrated business-led programs and the state?s efforts to expand opportunities. Both companies are founding members of the Chicago Apprenticeship Network, and each highlighted how apprenticeships have helped to build and maintain their respective workforces.  Aon is one of the 412 Registered Apprenticeship programs throughout Illinois. The Aon program allows apprentices to be regular, full-time Aon employees while they work their way to an associate?s degree through the City Colleges of Chicago. Upon successful completion, the workers have the opportunity to continue in their roles.  ?We wanted to make sure young people had the skills they needed to compete in the economy of the future,? said Bridget Gainer, Aon?s vice president of global public affairs. ?Through this program, we are learning that combining classroom education with real-world experience gives students from two-year colleges a winning formula.?"

Students will be able to earn while they learn ? making money while learning highly technical skilled trades such as Machining, Mechatronics, Cybersecurity and Field Service Technician. This gives employers the opportunity to compete on a global scale.  ?This is another example of how Lone Star College and Workforce Education continue to expand, to break barriers and lead the charge to help serve our communities and supply industry needs,? said Linda Leto Head, LSC associate vice chancellor, Workforce Education and Corporate Partnerships.

Flexible apprenticeship models can be customized to meet the needs of an organization. LSC?s well-recognized curriculum can be used to supplement employees? on-the-job training. The college?s job placement services department will help connect students and companies.  ?Students can earn while they learn, reducing the need to take on debt,? said James Carnes, U.S. Department of Labor Apprenticeship and Training representative. ?Apprenticeships are also an effective human resources strategy to recruit quality candidates, train employees to the specific needs of agencies, and retain a highly-skilled workforce.?"
1163,Staff,11/21/2017 7:56 AM,"For the men and women serving in the U.S. military, the transition to civilian life can be a battle of its own.

A pilot apprenticeship program sponsored by The Associated Builders and Contractors starting next year at Fort Drum in New York, home of the Army's 10th Mountain Division, looks to take away some of that uncertainty by providing valuable construction skills to service members before they make the next step into civilian life.

Michael Bellaman, the president and CEO of the national U.S. trade association, told Fox News on Monday the goal of this program is to take away the ""Fragmented"" feeling some veterans face when trying to look for employment, specifically in the construction industry in this case.

""One of the big problems is that once you are out of the military it's very, very difficult to find a portal and match up jobs in any kind of scale, aside from just putting that out in the paper,"" he said.

In a letter last year from The Chairman's Office of Reintegration, which leads the effort by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to enable the transition of veterans and their families back into civilian society, officials said around one million service members will hang up their uniforms in the next five years.

Bellaman, who is on President Trump's Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, said the program works by getting to veterans before they leave the military, but after they have an established discharge date.

Veterans can then build a successful career by combining classroom knowledge, hands-on instruction and paid employment experience.

COLORADO VA KEPT SECRET WAIT LISTS FOR VETS' MENTAL HEATH CARE, REPORT FINDS. As part of the program, service members receive free core construction training using an industry-recognized curriculum that's set up by the National Center for Construction Education & Research.

At Fort Drum, initial plans are for three classes per year, with an average class size of 10 to 15 people.

ABC, which is funding the entire program, expects to have at least 200 people complete the program over a 5-year period.

""What better place to recruit from than the military?"".

In the case of Fort Drum, a private company that's a member of ABC maintains and operates the family housing communities on base.

After completing the ""Core competency boot camp,"" ABC will also help work with its national network of 70 chapters and over 21,000 member companies to place them.

""The really neat thing about this is you have construction companies on bases, and so to be able to take that and take those kind of companies and marry them up with this opportunity makes a lot of sense,"" Bellaman told Fox News.

WWII VETERAN CALLS FOR HELP AND DIES AS NURSES LAUGH, VIDEO SHOWS. The program at Fort Drum will be similar to one the organization has used in previous settings to help veterans learn the electrical trade and earn their journeyman's license as a civilian.

William Stewart, a participant of one of those classes, told Construction News in 2015 he thought the classes were invaluable and prepared him to use skills first learned in the military in other settings.

""In the military, I was all about repair, replace, maintain,"" he said.

""I had no clue that there was a National Electric Code, and there was a reason why certain devices were put in certain places or at what heights or anything like that.""

One of the group's members hired over 2,000 veterans in both craft professionals and management roles last year, according to Bellaman.

Depending on how the pilot program at Fort Drum goes, Bellaman hopes to scale it up across the country at other military instillations, and wants to see it become a larger national initiative across other industries.

""This is something that our members are passionate about, because we are so appreciative over what our military has done,"" he told Fox News."

With over 900 events taking place across the United States, communities took the opportunity to draw attention to and recognize the important role that apprenticeships play in developing a skilled workforce.  Established in 2015 under the Obama Administration, NAW allows business, labor, education, and other community leaders the opportunity to publicly express and promote their support for apprenticeship programs.  These programs train millions of Americans and give job seekers the opportunities to acquire specialized skills and ultimately earn a competitive wage.

Apprenticeship programs have also been a priority Under the Trump Administration. Earlier the year the White House issued an executive order to substantially increase the number of U.S. apprenticeships, with an increased focus on information technology, manufacturing, and health care among other growth industries.  Currently there are a reported 505,000 individuals holding apprenticeships through 2,100 publicly funded programs. One such program includes the Goodwill Careers in Technology program funded through a Department of Labor TechHire grant, which allows three local Goodwill organizations to provide paid internships and registered apprenticeships to individuals training for career pathways in the information technology industry."

Florida's employers and workforce development, economic development and education entities are collaborating to bridge that gap with a new focus on apprenticeships.

The National Office of Apprenticeship, within the U.S. Department of Labor, has set a goal of doubling and diversifying the number of apprenticeships by 2019.

Florida is among 36 states and Guam recently selected to help make that big goal a reality through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative.

The responsibility tied to these grants is clear: build partnerships across key industries and organizations to create a strong talent pipeline for businesses in vital industries like advanced manufacturing and information technology.

Last month, I had the opportunity to talk with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta about the importance of expanding apprenticeship opportunities during his visit with Gov. Rick Scott in Tallahassee.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, there are more than 545,000 apprentices across the country, 4,800 of whom are in North Carolina.

Since 2013, Catawba County employers Technibilt, Sarstedt USA, GKN Sinter Metals and ZF Chassis Components, in addition to three other advanced manufacturers from neighboring counties, have partnered with Catawba Valley Community College and the NCDOL to offer four-year apprenticeships to high school juniors called ""Apprenticeship Catawba."" Students interested in Apprenticeship Catawba are considered by referral from their school counselors and must maintain a minimum GPA requirement and placement testing criteria.

The value of apprenticeship programs is clear to both the student and the employer.

Not only do these programs serve to close the skills gap, but nine out of 10 apprentices have a job upon completion of their programs, garnering an average starting salary of at least $34,000 per year.

Over the four-year program, apprentices earn their AAS Degree in Mechatronics Engineering Technology or an AAS in Computer Integrated Machining Technology from CVCC, and their Journeyman Certificate, with tuition and books paid in full by their employer sponsor.

They obtain 8,000 paid hours of on-the-job training provided by their employer.

For the employers themselves, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, for each dollar spent on apprenticeships, job creators are reported to receive approximately $1.50 return on their investment.

In order to recognize ""National Apprenticeship Week,"" along with the U.S. Department of Labor, and to reemphasize our community's commitment to advancing apprenticeship opportunities, I would like to feature one of the Apprenticeship Catawba partners.

Has your apprenticeship program helped alleviate your workforce challenges? If available, any data points on growth of the program would be helpful.

""We have been able to fill several technical positions through the apprenticeship program. Most recently we have filled five highly skilled positions with graduating apprentices.""

Is your apprenticeship program for youth, military or incumbent workers? What do apprentices gain from the program? Your organization?

""Sarstedt's apprenticeship program is primarily for young people who are still in high school. However, Sarstedt has had adult and military apprentices in the past. The apprentices gain a college education and hands-on work experience while earning a paycheck. All their tuition and school materials are paid for by the company and the apprentices have guaranteed jobs upon graduation. The company gains motivated and skilled employees who are trained over several years in several different areas within the organization.""

How do you coordinate with education systems to attract, recruit and retain apprentices?

""Sarstedt, Inc. is part of Apprenticeship Catawba through Catawba Valley Community College with other manufacturing organizations. The apprenticeship representatives visit the local high schools every year to present the apprenticeship opportunity to students. Sarstedt also has an open house for students and their parents every year to learn more about the apprenticeship program. The open house is followed by an orientation and internship for qualified students who are interested.""

Why is alignment between education systems and your apprenticeship program important to be successful?

""On the high school level, it is important to share this opportunity with students, teachers, counselors and parents, because there are still a large number of people who are not aware of this career path.""

It's a concept that is highly successful in some countries, like Germany, but it's not very common here.

The Texas Workforce Commission wants to change that.

The agency is working to ensure that all community colleges in the state accept apprenticeship credits through the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

1182,Staff Report,11/27/2017  8:00 AM,"Apprenticeship is not new. It is a proven earn-and-learn strategy, dating as far back as the Middle Ages, used to train highly skilled craftsmen. Traditionally the term refers to a program utilized by an employer combining on-the-job training with related classroom instruction preparing employees for jobs deemed most critical. While apprenticeship has always been linked to the trades, the model has evolved into a method to train the most highly skilled, knowledge-critical positions. Doctors, nurses and electricians are trained using this classroom and clinical model. Simulating the workplace is difficult and falls short of real-world experience that is requested by employers. Clinical or on-the-job training (OJT) is the most effective way to learn in real time using real equipment to address real situations.

Apprenticeship produces skilled professionals with real work experience, demonstrated competency, and work ethic?the model employee. This is every employer?s dream and a potential solution to workforce issues in Indiana and in the United States.  Though apprenticeship has been around since the Middle Ages, and is widely recognized as a successfully model, employers sometimes struggle to understand and adopt it as a strategy. It is not just a training program and requires commitment on the part of the employer and the employee. An agreement between the employer and employee needs to be well defined and provide a progressive wage to the employee as they attain more knowledge and skills, becoming increasingly valuable to the employer. The Department of Labor (DOL) applies this definition to programs that are registered with their state or federal offices. Registration means that the occupation or trade is aligned with a DOL-recognized standard ensuring rigor and competency. Registered apprentices successfully completing their apprenticeship attain an internationally recognized credential-journeyperson card-distinguishing them as masters or experts in their field or position."

1191,Staff,11/28/2017 8:51 AM,"Gary Lane's knees ached from years working as a locksmith, so his doctor said it was time to find a new career.

Patrick Andrews never really had a career, toiling in warehouses and dead-end jobs to support his daughter.

Robert Smith was a Walmart employee, but knew it would never lead to his dream of computer programming.

The three D.C. residents left their jobs to be part of a growing apprenticeship program in the city - freshly revamped as local and federal leaders look to apprenticeships to plug a widening gap between the city's affluent and poorer residents.

""This is my first career,"" said Andrews, 31, an apprentice at the D.C. Department of Public Works, where he is learning to repair vehicles in the city's fleet of garbage trucks, snowplows and cars.

""When you are on the Beltway, you never see a car not pulled over. To me, that's a sign that people need help with their cars and there's money there.""

City leaders view apprenticeships as a way to help the District's more than 25,000 unemployed residents - who are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic - secure well-paying jobs as a pathway into the middle class.

Those who can't afford to leave the workforce can receive financial assistance while they enroll in an apprenticeship, which lasts one to four years.

If apprentices complete a program, they typically are employed with an average starting salary of more than $60,000, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

In September, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser announced she would allocate $400,000 in additional grants to the city's apprenticeship program to diversify offerings and include more industries.

While many private companies fund their own apprenticeship programs, the city grants will be used, in part, to help companies pay apprentices.

The city has spent about $2 million on apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs since Bowser took office in 2014, paying residents while they become federally certified in a trade, said Odie Donald, director of D.C.'s Department of Employment Services.

Under the administration, the number of people participating in apprenticeship programs has grown from 600 to 1,300, with about 60 percent of them living in Wards 7 and 8.

""We have apprenticeships that touch both traditional and nontraditional industries,"" he said.

""I don't want to say there is nothing that is not apprenticable, but there are very few occupations that are not apprenticable.""

Smith, the former Walmart employee, is in a year-long apprenticeship with technology company Securetech360, where he is learning the ins and outs of repairing advanced conference room equipment.

He also is starting to take classes in software development and coding.

Smith, 22, already received his ""A-Plus,"" an entry-level computer technician certification.

He said he eventually wants to work in ""Ethical computer hacking.""

""As the days went by in my retail job, I grew unsatisfied,"" he said.

""Ever since elementary school, I've been interested in computers.""

Apprenticeship programs appear to be an area where the District's and federal government's interests are in sync.

The Obama administration began to prioritize job training programs and the push has continued under President Trump, who signed an executive order in June to expand apprenticeship programs.

The order nearly doubled the amount of federal money for apprenticeship programs nationwide to $200 million, reallocating funds from existing job programs.

The expansion of apprenticeship programs in the District comes after the city was considered to have one of the worst job-training programs in the country before a recent turnaround.

In September, the Department of Labor gave the city a vote of confidence, ending its designation as a ""High-risk"" partner in job training and employment programs.

The city had low enrollment numbers in workforce training programs, but the federal labor agency said the city has started to reverse that trend.

Donald said apprenticeships are one component of the push to get unemployed or underemployed residents into careers.

There are also pre-apprenticeships, which don't have a federal certification component, and the On-the-Job Training Program matching job trainees and employers, with D.C. paying part of the trainee's salary for up to six months.

D.C. Public Schools also offers career training for students in high schools.

""It's a connected effort across all of D.C. government to fix this gap,"" Donald said.

D.C. Council member Elissa Silverman, chairwoman of the Committee on Labor and Workforce Development, said the city needs to better inform residents about apprenticeship program offerings.

She said the building trades industries, such as painting and welding, have a number of slots available for apprentices that residents aren't filling.

Silverman and Ward 8 Council member Trayon White are preparing legislation that would expand apprenticeships at local government agencies.

""The reason why you see excitement about apprenticeships, and certainly on the District level, is it's a way to earn and learn,"" Silverman said.

""They connect job seekers with jobs and it also helps build our future workforce.""

Gary Lane, 49, an apprentice at the Department of Public Works, said he hopes to continue working with D.C. government long after completing his program.

""I'd hate to take the knowledge and go somewhere else,"" he said.

""If they train me here, I want to stay."""

It's also the main access road to the Wolfe's Neck Center for Agriculture and the Environment.

Metaphorically speaking, Burnett Road is a cakewalk when compared with the real-life obstacles facing new dairy farmers, a fact that prompted Wisconsin dairy farmer Joe Tomandl III to create the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship program in 2010.

Under Tomandl, the program became the first U.S. Department of Labor-accredited national farming apprentice program in history.

Tomandl also knew that a shortage of dairy farmers was underway at the time.

So he decided to find ways to help new dairy farmers obtain training, guidance and assistance in facing the hurdles with starting a new dairy business.

Sarah Littlefield, dairy director for the 626-acre Wolfe's Neck Center for Agriculture and the Environment, established and supervises a two-year apprenticeship program where graduates become dairy farmers.

At Wolfe's Neck farm, cows are rotated through grazing paddocks of high-quality grasses, allowing unused paddocks to recover and regrow, Littlefield said.

Once cows move to the next grazing area, chickens, a henhouse and a movable fence set up shop.

While the history of the land spans 250 years, the farm as its known today began in 1947 when Eleanor and Lawrence M.C. Smith of Philadelphia purchased the property.

The farm takes its name from Henry and Rachel Woolfe, European colonists who established a homestead on the narrow peninsula that sits between Casco Bay and the Harraseeket River, southeast of Freeport.

In 1949, Eleanor Smith joined the Cumberland County Soil Conservation District, triggering the couple's future plans for the farm.

""Three years ago, Wolfe's Neck Farm started their dairy program. Two years ago, I received a phone call from a colleague/friend at Stonyfield asking whether I'd be willing to look at the project here and advise Ben Jensen, the farm manager, and Matthew DeGrandpre, the herd and operations manager, as they started their adventure in dairy here. Matthew is the third generation to help run the farm,"" Littlefield said.

A short time later, Littlefield accepted an offer to work on the farm full time.

There were some dairy cattle on the farm when Littlefield came, but dairy infrastructure was nonexistent.

A beef barn, built in the 1970s, was used to house the dairy herd, and farmhands utilized a portable vacuum pump and bucket for milking.

Today, the herd of 40 cows are milked twice a day in a modern dairy parlor.

The Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship has a rolling admissions program with six openings at a time.

Last month there were five apprentices from Oregon, Virginia, New York, Missouri and Maine.

Apprentices are paid and live in a farmhouse on-site.

They spend more than 3,000 hours working on the farm and another 300-plus hours in related classroom studies.

Abagial ""Abbi"" Smith, 22, of Durham just finished her seventh month as an apprentice.

A 2013 graduate of Freeport High School, she earned an associate's degree in 2016 from Kennebec Valley Community College's sustainable agriculture program.

While completing the apprenticeship program, she is also bringing life back to a 27-acre Auburn farm, half of which is forest formerly owned by her grandfather.

""I really want to diversify what I know,"" said Smith, whose previous farming experience was limited to sheep and beef.

""I'd like to have a diversified farm of my own at some point, possibly having a dairy aspect. By using sustainable agriculture, I'm not wasting those resources and I'm not running myself into the ground and I'll be helping my community in some way.""

While Smith expects to develop some component of organic farming, she is not sure if she will do a 100-percent organic farming operation.

She does want the majority of her farm to be pasture based.

Mexico, Missouri, native Josh Harlan, 23, who has been at Wolfe's Neck for 11 months, grew up on a 300-acre conventional beef farm.

About the same time, Harlan moved to Maine to participate in a six-month beef internship program at Aldermere Farm in Rockport.

""The beef cattle brought me to Maine and the dairy cattle kept me,"" said Harlan, who holds a bachelor's degree in agribusiness/animal science from Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau.

""Aldermere Farm is one of the oldest Belted Galloway cattle breeders in the country. I'm hoping to find another DGA master in Maine who will take me on. I know I want to have a diversified farm, but I don't know what my specialty will be - beef or dairy and some sheep.""

About five weeks ago in the nearby community of New Vineyard, a dairy farmer, Randall Bates, was seriously injured by an uncooperative 1,400-pound cow.

Jill, Randall Bates' wife, knew she would not be able to run the farm while her husband recovered, so she called friends for help.

Among the people she contacted was Richard Kersbergen, the education coordinator for the apprenticeship program at Wolfe's Neck and a professor of sustainable dairy and forage systems with University of Maine Cooperative Extension.

Kersbergen called Littlefield and the call for volunteers went out to the dairy apprentices.

Within three days of Randall's accident, Harlan began helping on the farm.

He spent 10 days on the 544-acre Springside Farm before leaving on a previously scheduled trip."

Gov. Tom Wolf announced the program, meant to close skills gaps in the workplace and provide career pathways, according to a news release.  ?The expansion of our apprenticeship programs provides Pennsylvania companies and our workforce with a competitive edge,? Wolf said. ?The creation of this new program reinforces our commitment to providing job seekers with hands-on training and helps to create a pipeline of highly skilled talent for employers.?

DCED is accepting grant proposals from apprenticeship sponsors including single employers, employer consortiums, workforce development boards, economic development organizations, labor organizations, career tech schools, Pennsylvania community colleges, and community organizations. Eligible apprenticeships must be registered with the state Department of Labor and Industry?s Apprenticeship and Training Office.

Widely used in Europe, apprenticeships have bipartisan support among U.S. policymakers as a route to employment outside traditional higher education?and without student debt. But the actual number of apprenticeships in the United States remains small. Only 27 occupations currently leverage apprenticeship models, accounting for roughly 410,000 apprentices, out of more than 23.4 million job openings in 2016, according to federal statistics.

In Room to Grow: Identifying New Frontiers for Apprenticeships, the researchers examined more than 23 million job postings to identify occupations whose characteristics were similar to existing apprenticeships. The characteristics included requiring a narrow set of specialized skills without heavy licensing, having largely stable workforces, and consistently paying a living wage.  Most existing apprenticeships are concentrated in skilled trades, such as carpenters, glaziers, and sheet metal workers."

The Collaborative will collect and share information on emerging trends and best practices in apprenticeship from across the country. In particular, we will highlight how apprenticeship can break into new industry sectors and serve a more diverse population of learners and workers.  The Collaborative builds on the success of the May 2017 Apprenticeship Forward national conference, which brought together over six hundred practitioners, policymakers, and apprenticeship advocates for a wide-ranging conversation on opportunities to expand American apprenticeship. The conference revealed a vibrant and increasingly diverse field of apprenticeship but also a lack of strong connections across different industry sectors, population groups, and geographic regions.

The Apprenticeship Forward Collaborative will work to strengthen connections across the apprenticeship community and build greater public awareness and support for apprenticeship programs. Over the course of the next year, the Collaborative will organize information-sharing sessions among member organizations, host public events in different parts of the country that feature local programs and practitioners, and brief policymakers on opportunities to support apprenticeship. We will engage apprenticeship experts, businesses and educators, government agencies, as well as the broader public to take advantage of the broad and growing interest in apprenticeship models."

One student, Clara, left inspired: ""I had never thought that I was capable of doing something like this. I am very glad that I went on the manufacturing field trip with my school.""

It's essential for students like Clara, who may have never considered a career in the skilled trades before, to explore a variety of career opportunities.

If she chooses to pursue a career in skilled trades, an apprenticeship will help her develop the skills needed to excel in the workforce.

As we head into National Apprenticeship Week, it's key for businesses to promote apprenticeship opportunities.

National Apprenticeship Week is a national celebration that offers leaders in business, labor, education and more a chance to express their support for apprenticeships.

This year's National Apprenticeship Week will take place Nov. 13-19, 2017.NAW will feature apprentice graduations, business open houses, school career fairs, apprenticeship signing days, skills competitions and industry roundtable events.

The events throughout the week highlight the benefits of apprenticeships in preparing a highly skilled workforce to meet the talent needs of employers across a variety of industries.

As more workers from the baby boomer generation begin to retire, it's essential we pass on their skills and knowledge to a capable workforce.

Apprentices receive the necessary training and knowledge for a successful career, and ultimately stand out among other applicants in their field who don't have the prior training.

There are more than 545,000 apprentices nationwide in more than 1,000 occupations.

In the State of Michigan alone, there are more than 14,000 active apprentices.

Nearly nine out of 10 apprentices are employed after completing their apprenticeship, with an average starting salary of at least $60,000 per year.

According to Time Magazine, the average salary for a college graduate in 2016 was $50,556.

Workers who complete apprenticeship programs earn $300,000 more over a career than their peers who don't.

Having the training and skills in your particular field really pay off in the long run.

Apprentices earn while they learn, reducing their need to take on debt.

The opportunity to earn money while learning your particular craft is hugely beneficial.

Not having student loan debt to worry about when jumping into a career leads to financial stability and less stress.

We?re seeing more and more people that are looking at one- and two-year degrees for the jobs that we have now and are also looking at health, technology, agriculture. These are booming sectors right now in our economy and it only makes sense that Riverland is supplying that need.?

Klobuchar, who serves on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, introduced the legislation along with Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine.  ?I think that?s important because Maine, like Minnesota, has a lot of rural areas and they want to keep them strong,? she said.

1209,Gabriela Rico,11/5/2017 5:15 AM,"A local contractor is responding to the shortage in skilled laborers by growing them internally.

Sun Mechanical Contracting Inc. offers sheet metal, HVAC and plumbing apprenticeships to its employees who then graduate from the program as journeymen.

""As the economy in Arizona rebounds from the recession, the construction industry faces a challenge in hiring skilled labor,"" said Marc Kinseth, president of Sun Mechanical.

""We started the apprenticeship program in an effort to close the skilled labor gap while giving employees an incredible opportunity for advancement.""

For 25-year-old Patrick Schlaefer, it was a way to learn a trade that could become a career.

""I got into the trade because I didn't fully graduate high school and my father drilled into me, 'If you don't go to school you need something to fall back on,'"" he said.

""When the program presented itself, I realized it is school - college-level classes for construction.""

""I learned formulas and layout skills.""

The program takes about four years to complete and was created with the cooperation of the Arizona Department of Commerce Apprenticeship Office and the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship.

Apprenticeships are open to current Sun Mechanical employees and the process is competitive.

Every student receives a minimum of 8,000 hours of on-the-job training and 650 hours of classroom instruction.

Students then receive certification from the state and Department of Labor.

Schlaefer received his certification in sheet metal and has worked in various settings, including hospitals and buildings at the University of Arizona.

Army veteran Fabian Lopez, 37, worked with concrete jobs in Nogales after leaving the service in 2007.

After hearing about the apprentice program at Sun Metal, he applied.

""The program seemed like something that I couldn't let go by,"" said Lopez, who got certified in HVAC. ""I put my 'A' tests on the fridge at home. I'm proud. It makes you feel good inside, like you're a part of something.""

A recent report by the Associated General Contractors of America shows the majority of firms are having a hard time filling hourly craft positions such as carpenters, electricians, laborers and painters.

Short-term, the report says, firms will hesitate to bid on construction projects for fear of not having the workforce to meet contractual obligations.

Long-term, construction companies will turn to new technology such as drones, robotics and GPS-guided equipment to compensate, thus eliminating these jobs for future generations.

""For companies, apprenticeship programs would mean that instead of waiting fruitlessly for skilled workers to walk in the door, they could build the workforce they need,"" Bloomberg said in a recent opinion piece.

""Government's role would be to supply enough money to help subsidize the salaries of the apprentices, certify that the apprenticeships meet certain minimum standards, push community colleges to align themselves with an apprenticeship movement, and help create a culture where apprenticeships are seen as a head-held-high alternative to a college degree.""

Kinseth said that was the goal of starting the apprenticeship and in turn the company has loyal workers.

""Employees gain skills that make them more competent in their trades, and employers gain dedicated, skilled team members,"" he said.

Sun Mechanical was founded in 1977 as a Tucson-based plumbing company.

The company has grown into a full-service mechanical contracting and construction firm in Southern Arizona, providing plumbing, piping, heating and ventilation, fabricated sheet metal, and more.

Linda Kinseth, the program's training coordinator, said the company was looking for a way to stand out when recruiting new workers.

About 23 employees have graduated from the program and 13 are currently enrolled, Kinseth said.

The apprenticeship is something Sun Mechanical points out when bidding on a job.

""It's definitely something we include in our proposals,"" Kinseth said.

""The training is very extensive and reflects how important quality is for us."""

Hall?s proclamation, which recognizes the role apprenticeships play in preparing Cody workers for viable careers with livable wages, marks the 80th anniversary of the National Apprenticeship Act that founded the National Apprenticeship System.  Signed by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937, the act established a widespread system of partnerships among employers, labor, educational institutions and federal and state governments that has shaped skilled training for subsequent generations of workers, including those in Cody.

Cody Apprenticeship Week honors local businesses already using the apprenticeship model. At the same time, it encourages others to consider using the model to train more workers.  According to the proclamation, six Cody employers offer apprenticeship training in four occupations for five apprentices registered with the National Apprenticeship System.

1230,Brandpoint (bpt),11/8/2017 6:37 AM,"With U.S. graduation rates being at an all-time high, one might expect employers to have a wealth of qualified candidates to hire.

Instead, many employers are finding that these recent graduates are unprepared to succeed in the workforce.

While many are graduating with technical skills, their ""Soft skills"" are lacking.

These skills - from professional communication and critical thinking to collaboration and time management - are seen as critical by employers, yet have not historically been taught with consistency or prioritized.

A recent whitepaper commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and AVID, an education nonprofit that equips students with the necessary soft skills needed to be successful in college and their careers, highlights recent partnerships between the business and education sectors to tackle this skills gap.

""Bridging the Soft Skills Gap: How Employers Can Partner with Educators to Prepare Students for the 21st Century Workforce"" offers practical recommendations for businesses to make an impact and profiles strategic partnerships being successfully implemented across the country by Nike, Ernst & Young, Wegmans, Wynn Las Vegas, and the Northern Kentucky Education Council.

According to a 2016 analysis by the Wall Street Journal, 92 percent of nearly 900 surveyed executives said soft skills were as or more important than technical skills, yet 89 percent reported some level of difficulty finding employees who have mastered these skills.

""With almost 6 million unfilled jobs in America, this lack of soft skills hurts workers, businesses and the economy,"" says Cheryl Oldham of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Center for Education and Workforce.

""Businesses recognize the critical need for soft skills and are working hard in their communities to help students obtain the skills they need to succeed in the jobs of tomorrow.""

A growing number of companies are focusing on student education as a part of their business strategy.

By equipping students with the skills for workplace success, they strengthen their talent pipeline and create shared value.

The following insights from the whitepaper offers successful approaches to collaboration between the education and business sectors to help youth become better prepared for their careers.

Investing in classroom solutions empowers teachers to better help young people develop the skills they need in school, work, and life.

Since promoting soft skills is less about what is taught than how they are taught, access to hands-on methodology training for educators is vital.

Employers can help by ensuring that teachers and administrators across local schools have access to proven professional development programs from established education nonprofits.

Businesses can mobilize employees to mentor students based upon a college and career readiness curriculum.

Proponents of these mentoring programs say that they enhance employee satisfaction and retention; strengthen the talent pipeline; and contribute to thriving communities.

In adopting a specific school or school district, businesses typically identify and commit to meeting a holistic set of needs through multifaceted programming, ranging from tutoring and mentoring to specific grants for programming and facilities.

Instead of solely offering traditional internships for college students, businesses can partner with high schools to establish pre-employment apprenticeship programs designed to introduce students to workplace demands.

The Department of Labor supports employers that establish Registered Apprenticeships to build a robust talent pipeline.

Building a coalition of representatives from industry, the education system, and the community creates the space for meaningful dialogue about common priorities and unique local challenges.

It also facilitates collective action around solutions."
1231,Kathryn Moody,11/9/2017  11:00 AM,"Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta confirmed the U.S. Department of Labor's intent to deregulate in favor of ?unleashing jobs? and to repeal rulemaking that ?impinges on liberty,? at the American Bar Association's Labor and Employment Law Conference Thursday.  The independent workforce in particular served as a key example of how Acosta views the role of labor and employment law. ?It may be time to update laws,? he said at the Washington, D.C., event, stating that the gig economy was here to stay. And despite the department's recent return to Administrator's Interpretations, he spoke out against using that type of tool to regulate. ?It?s easy for the executive branch to say, ?this is what we think,? but that?s not how democracy works,? he said.  He also noted the department is looking at the tip credit rule, the overtime rule, and the fiduciary rule ? all of which have been delayed or are under consideration for revision.

The most interesting aspect of his comments may be the strong position against rulemaking by executive fiat, which explains many of the department?s actions thus far. This administration has taken essentially the opposite stance of the Obama-era DOL, which some accused ? particularly in the case of the overtime rule ? of overstepping its bounds.  Job creation remains a focus of this DOL. Though Acosta did not mention apprenticeships at this event, DOL has publicly focused on improving access to apprenticeships throughout the country as a way to help Americans take higher-skilled jobs. In October, the White House rolled out its Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, which followed a June executive order funneling money to apprenticeships and rolling back government monitoring of such programs."
1233,James Long,11/9/2017  2:23 PM,"A lawmaker from southern Illinois has introduced a bi-partisan bill to make USDA apprenticeships available to veterans.  The legislation was introduced by Rep. Mike Bost R-IL and Rep. Al Lawson D-FL.

?Our bipartisan bill provides a common-sense solution for helping our farmers and ranchers fill jobs and expand their operations while offering our veterans new skills and a potential career path after their service,? said Bost. ?Representative Lawson and I sit right next to each other in the House Agriculture Committee, we both have rural economies in our districts, and we both know there?s no more dedicated workforce than our returning military men and women. I?m proud to carry this bill right before Veterans Day to give a hand up to our returning heroes.?  The bill called the Veterans Agricultural Apprenticeship Act asks the USDA to work with agriculture departments in states to identify farmers and ranchers eligible for a loan to train veterans. The loan would then be paid back to the USDA after harvest season."
1234,Business Wire,11/9/2017 11:55 AM,"BELLEVUE, Neb.-()-The Nebraska Commissioner of Labor John Albin will join Bellevue University leaders and representatives from the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday, Nov. 16, at 9 a.m., to announce a new partnership between the University and the Departments of Labor to jointly develop a series of registered apprenticeship programs for employers in Nebraska and across the country.

Team members from North End Teleservices, a global provider of multi-channel contact center services, headquartered in northeast Omaha, will be special guests at the National Apprenticeship Week Event, which will be held in the Criss Auditorium located in the Hitchcock Humanities Center on the Bellevue University campus, 1040 Bruin Blvd., in Bellevue, Nebraska.

Bellevue University, one of the nation's leaders in preparing adults for lifelong career success with career-relevant knowledge and skills, is the first four-year educational institution in Nebraska to enter into a partnership through the USDOL Apprenticeship Program.

According to University President Mary Hawkins, the University's College of Continuing and Professional Education has already developed a Standards of Apprenticeship program for the Office Manager/Front Line Supervisor, with other occupational apprenticeship programs expected to follow.

""Our partnership with the USDOL and the NDOL exemplifies Bellevue University's commitment to prepare people to thrive in a connected, competitive world,"" said University President Mary Hawkins.

In Nebraska and nationally, apprenticeships continue to grow.

According to the USDOL, there are more than 545,000 apprenticeships nationwide in more than 1,000 occupations, including between 5,400 and 10,400 in Nebraska.

Debra Cremeens-Risinger, State Director of the USDOL Office of Apprenticeship, says the new relationship with Bellevue University benefits both individuals seeking employment, as well as employers.

""This partnership enables the USDOL to meet the needs of our constituents, who are the American people,"" she said.

""Not only are nine out of 10 of apprentices employed after they complete an apprenticeship, apprentices also earn significantly more over the span of their careers than their peers who don't complete these types of programs."" Cremeens-Risinger added that employers see positive returns from their investment, as well.

""For every dollar spent on apprenticeship programs, employers receive approximately $1.50 in ROI."".

According to the USDOL, Registered Apprenticeships include requirements for related classroom instruction and paid on-the-job learning with appropriate supervision.

Apprentices who successfully complete the instruction and training receive a nationally recognized, portable certificate of completion.

Carmen Tapio, CEO of North End Teleservices, is proud to be the first workforce partner participating in the partnership.

Founded in 2015, North End Teleservices provides call center and back office support to local and international clients.

The company, which was named the 2016 Greater Omaha Chamber's Small Business of the Year for 2016, will hire its first apprentice, who will receive training through the BU-USDOL partnership.

""Our goal is to employ up to 200 people,"" said Tapio, ""And this partnership will help ensure our employees have the skills needed to support both our current operations and our future customers.""

This initial apprenticeship with North End is the first Contact Center Outsourcing apprenticeship in the state and one of the first in the country.

The company, the Departments of Labor and Bellevue University plan on developing additional apprenticeships to provide a Contact Center career path, which according to Tapio, makes sense as Omaha has long been acknowledged as the birthplace of the outsourced contact center industry.

Founded in 1966, Bellevue University is a non-profit, fully accredited university with more than 50,000 graduates worldwide.

The University is a recognized national leader in preparing students for lifelong success with career-relevant knowledge and skills, while making college affordable.

Routinely ranked among the nation's top military-friendly and open access institutions, the University serves students at its main campus in Bellevue, Nebraska, and everywhere online.

The University is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission through the U.S. Department of Education.

Founded in 2015, North End Teleservices is a global provider of omni-channel contact center services and its leadership has over 85 years of helping clients with outsourced services.

The company offers services, including customer service, social media management, business-to-business sales, student registration, transportation logistics, member services and back office support to customers in insurance, travel and hospitality, financial and retail industries.

North End Teleservices is a certified minority-owned enterprise located in a federal HUBzone with the mission of providing Service Excellence and Changing Lives."
1235,Kimberly Cassidy and Gina Siesing,11/9/2017 5:45 AM,"The recent presidential executive order ""Expanding Apprenticeships in America"" and the proposed JOBS Act, which would amend the Higher Education Act, both look to solve the skills gap by increasing support for short-term training in current technology.

Such training can provide some students with current technical skills.

According to a World Economic Forum report on employment trends across a wide range of industries, the competencies most needed for long-term employment are more foundational: critical thinking, collaboration, communication and creativity - as well as digital fluency.

To close the skills gap and provide long-term employability, we in higher education must continue to offer a broad-based education in which digital skills are not developed within a single set of courses, but rather throughout the entire curriculum and the wider array of co-curricular experiences.

First, by infusing digital skills into all aspects of education, faculty members, administrators and students must think about which digital skills, competencies and fluencies are actually needed for success and leadership in a given area - beyond the boundary of a single course and in ways that reflect the fact that digital skills are interdisciplinary, interconnected and contextually embedded.

Our colleagues at Bryn Mawr College have developed just such an approach to maximize our students' digital competencies.

We obtained extensive information from faculty members, staff members, parents and graduates from a diverse set of fields and professions to create a matrix of the kinds of technical understanding and critical use of data and digital tools that students need to thrive in their course work, research, internships and future professional pathways.

We then mapped to that matrix the learning opportunities that students had in our curriculum and co-curricular programs.

Using that approach, we were able to see and show how students attained needed skills and also identify and address skill gaps.

We found many areas of overlap, too, which often opened up several different pathways for students to reach the same objective.

The second advantage to this approach is that it allows all students, not just those focused on careers in technology, to reflect purposefully on their professional interests and aspirations and to build the digital abilities needed for opportunities and success.

Thus, all students are engaged in digital development that can build on skills and knowledge they already have, and not everyone has to start in the same place.

Finally, this approach encourages critical analysis and positions digital skills as means to an end, rather than a pursuit in and of themselves.

Through students' reflection on what skills are useful to meet their goals, students learn to write and speak about their new abilities and to consider how well the tools serve their ultimate purpose.

While colleges should include courses in programming, data visualization and statistics, more students develop digital fluency more quickly and easily when digital tools are integrated throughout the curriculum - from classical and Near Eastern archaeology to behavioral economics.

Digital instruction is most effective when it's in the service of students' individual interests and goals.

Digital skills are also learned through many student campus jobs - as research assistants or IT or library support staff - and through co-curricular activities in clubs, community service and preprofessional internships.

By infusing opportunities to gain digital competencies throughout students' entire experience, we help students obtain skills in context; learn to use skills in new environments; and practice the inherent interconnectedness of skills and ideas, theories and outcomes.

They also analyze digital tools through close examination, challenging assumed ideas and advancing evidence and arguments.

This approach to technology education produces students who are truly prepared for the jobs of tomorrow - with transferable and flexible digital skills, the ability to understand the best tool for the job, and the knowledge to use and improve those tools thoughtfully and ethically with an understanding of the context where they will be deployed and the people who will use them.

In this transitional age, digital tools, data science, the internet of things, complex social media networks, and virtual and augmented reality generate both innovative practices and distinctive ethical and social issues.

While there is a place for short-term technology training to meet immediate workplace needs, we cannot neglect investment in preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow.

To close the skills gap in the long term, we need to offer students broad educational opportunities that help them to understand the tools they are using, that support the development of the skills and creative and critical thinking needed for continued innovation, and that empower graduates to influence the ways that these technologies are employed in their fields and communities."
1236,Sherri Buri McDonald,12/1/2017 10:19 AM,"A new program that in the past year has placed almost 100 apprentices in Washington tech firms, such as Amazon and Microsoft, is coming to Lane County.

Apprenti is a tech apprenticeship program that meets the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, which helps to fund it.

It trains and places apprentices in such positions as software developer, Web developer, network security administrator, Windows or Linux system administrator, cloud support specialist, data center technician and information technology support professional.

Apprenti and local partners Lane Workforce Partnership and industry group Technology Association of Oregon hope to start training the first group of local apprentices as early as March, said Jessica McCormick, Lane Workforce Partnership's workforce project manager.

The goal is to place 45 tech apprentices in Lane County firms in the next three years; 10 in the first year and the remaining 35 in the following two years, she said.

Apprenticeship applicants must be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma or equivalent, and be eligible to work in the United States.

Candidates can apply at apprenticareers.org.

There is strong interest by companies, and participating firms will be disclosed by year's end, said Allison Weatherly, Technology Association of Oregon events manager.

Apprentices will undergo rigorous unpaid training for 14 to 20 weeks, followed by a year of paid on-the-job training.

The program's purpose is two-fold: to respond to local tech firms' need for skilled workers and to open a new recruiting door, increasing opportunities for women, minorities and veterans to enter an industry where they are underrepresented.

""We are thrilled to launch the Apprenti program to provide an opportunity for everyone in the greater Eugene area to take a leap into a tech career,"" Weatherly said.

""This is a tremendous opportunity for our community to continue paving the way in broadening our talent pool that leads to rewarding, valuable careers in the local tech industry.""

Lane County has 443 tech firms, and the sector's workforce is projected to grow 28 percent in the next 10 years, the state Employment Department projects.

Apprenticeships can help young workers gain essential experience.

They can help older workers transition to a new field or help those who have been out of the job market, such as parents of young children, re-enter the workforce, Weatherly said.

""It opens the door for a lot of different people,"" she said.

Participants in the Apprenti program in Washington ranged in age from 20 to 57, Weatherly said.

Some of the apprentices in Washington's program had four-year college degrees in a non-tech field and used the apprenticeship to transition to a tech career, McCormick said.

Apprenticeships are the latest example of the local tech industry's efforts to expand the pipeline of skilled workers.

Area companies recently collaborated with the Technology Association of Oregon and Connected Lane County, a local education and industry partnership, to launch summer tech work experiences for high school students and teachers.

Apprenticeships are another way for companies to show that they value education and on-the-job training, Weatherly said.

Lane County companies outside the tech industry also may participate in the Apprenti program as long as they use technology in their business and have an IT department with a supervisor who has at least three years of industry experience, McCormick said.

Groups of apprentices first will complete 14 to 20 weeks of classroom-style unpaid training, Weatherly said.

Apprentices training to be software developers will learn programming languages and other core concepts as a group.

Companies hosting the apprentices will have input on the curriculum, Weatherly said.

Apprentices are expected to focus on the training and not have a job at the same time, Weatherly said.

Then apprentices begin on-the-job training at their host companies.

Apprentices are paid 60 percent of their job's market value in the first six months and 70 percent of market value in the second six months, McCormick said.

Employers pay the program a $2,500 placement fee per apprentice.

Weatherly and McCormick will recruit candidates, conduct a four-hour assessment of each candidate and present several candidates for each company to choose from, McCormick said.

Weatherly and McCormick will check with the apprentice and employer at six months and at nine months.

""At nine months, we'll find out whether the company can take the apprentice on as full-time employee,"" McCormick said.

""If not, we work with the apprentice to start looking for employment.""

Lane County's Apprenti program will cost $700,000 over three years, McCormick said.

The money is part of a $3 million American Apprenticeship Grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to the state Employment Department, she said.

Apprenti, which is based in the Seattle area, is expanding its program to Oregon, California, Michigan and Ohio.

Technology Association of Oregon will help roll out the apprenticeship program in Lane County and in Bend.

What: A new tech apprenticeship program will host presentations for groups interested in referring apprenticeship candidates."
1237,Ashley A. Smith,12/1/2017 4:00 AM,"Apprenticeships are commonly identified with skilled trades such as welding and carpentry, but new research indicates that expanding apprenticeships into other occupations would lead to more job opportunities.  Researchers from Harvard Business School?s Managing the Future Work Project and Burning Glass Technologies, a labor market analytics company, found that the number of occupations that commonly use apprenticeships could be expanded -- from 27 to 74.

That increase alone would open up to 3.3 million job opportunities that could be filled by apprentices, according to the researchers? report. The 27 occupations that currently use apprenticeship models account for approximately 410,000 apprentices.  ?We are underutilizing apprenticeships as an education and training model, and it could be much more widely spread,? said Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills with the education policy program at New America and a former official at the U.S. Education and Labor Departments. ?[The researchers] even make a good case that it?s not even being used enough in the skilled trades and occupations related to skilled trades.?"
1238,Staff Report,12/1/2017 8:00 AM,"Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta announced members of a new Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion-an advisory group appointed to identify strategies and propose regulations to grow apprenticeship that will include Montez L. King, Executive Director for NIMS. The Task Force is chaired by Secretary Acosta and vice chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Among the members are representatives of American companies, trade/industry groups, educational institutions and labor unions.

President Trump's June 15th Executive Order targets the expansion of apprenticeship and vocational education while closing the skills gap and reducing regulatory burdens on workforce development programs.  ""Right now, there are 6.1 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and another 6.8 million people seeking employment. Manufacturing alone will see two million jobs go unfilled over the next decade due to the skills gap,"" King said. ""Apprenticeship is the `work-and-learn' solution that we need. Apprentices learn in-demand skills from industry experts while getting paid, which eases the apprentices' student debt as a result. Apprenticeship is a win for individuals and industry."""
1243,Roy Maurer Dec 11,12/11/2017 1:02 PM,"Many believe good jobs for workers without a bachelor's degree no longer exist in a labor market buffeted by automation and globalization, but there are still plenty of ""Middle-income"" jobs out there, according to recent research.

A report conducted by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in collaboration with JPMorgan Chase & Co. found that although the decline in U.S. manufacturing eliminated many quality jobs for workers with only a high school degree, there are currently 30 million jobs in the U.S. that pay well and do not require a bachelor's degree.

These jobs have a median annual salary of $55,000 and a minimum annual salary of $35,000.

""In the past, these good jobs were found almost entirely in manufacturing and other blue-collar industries like transportation and construction,"" said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce and lead author of the report.

""Today, new jobs in skilled-services industries, such as health care, finance and information technology, have steadily been replacing good jobs lost in traditional blue-collar industries.""

Manufacturing and construction still have the majority of these jobs , but that is changing.

Skilled-services jobs include occupations like computer support techs, HR generalists, firefighters, nurses, sales and customer service representatives, and accountants.

Over 4 million such jobs have been added since 1991, while about 2.8 million jobs were lost in manufacturing during that time.

""We find that the number of workers with good jobs that pay without a has increased over the past quarter century-from 27 million in 1991 to 30 million today, even with large losses in manufacturing employment,"" Carnevale said.

The catch is that to compete for many of these newer skilled-services roles, workers need some education or training beyond their high school diploma, he added.

Those with only high school diplomas still have the largest share of these middle-income jobs, but that share continues to decline.

Those with bachelor's degrees are taking an increasing share of these jobs, the research found.

""For the past several decades the nation has operated under a simple principle-the surest path to labor-market success is through a bachelor's degree at a four-year college or university,"" said Mark Schneider, vice president at the American Institutes for Research and a visiting scholar in education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, there are roughly 2 million bachelor's degrees granted annually, followed by about 1 million associate's degrees granted and just under 1 million nondegree certificates.

Associate's degree holders have gained the most middle-income jobs in both blue-collar and skilled-services industries since 1991, according to the Georgetown Center report.

While on average bachelor's degree holders earn more than those with associate's degrees, certificates and apprenticeships, earnings vary widely based on factors such as the choice of major, Schneider said.

""Skills-oriented programs in health, engineering and other technical fields are typically more remunerative than many programs in traditional academic fields,"" he said.

""If we move beyond our current fixation on the bachelor's degree and include all the postsecondary pathways at our disposal, far more educational options emerge that can lead students to economic success.""

Tim Lawrence, executive director of SkillsUSA, an organization that helps prepare students for careers in trade, technical and skilled-service occupations, stresses that there is a tremendous opportunity for job seekers in commercial construction and advanced manufacturing due to talent shortages in those fields.

""There has never been a better time to have technical skills than right now,"" Lawrence said.

""It's a sellers' market for any person entering the workforce with technical skills grounded in academics, and personal skills like communication and teamwork. The latest annual Manpower Talent Shortage survey shows that once again skilled trade occupations are the toughest jobs to fill in the United States and worldwide. These are jobs that require apprenticeships, a two-year high school program or community [or] technical college pathways.""

More than one-quarter of Americans hold a nondegree credential, such as a certificate or an occupational license or certification, and about one-fifth have completed a work experience program such as an internship, residency or apprenticeship, according to a survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, based on responses from 47,744 adults.

Apprenticeships blend on-the-job work with paid classroom instruction, and they usually last two to six years.

The number of new entrants in registered apprenticeship programs increased by 50 percent from 2008 to 2015 to include just over 500,000 active registered apprentices.

Over 150,000 employers have adopted registered apprenticeships.

President Donald Trump has made apprenticeship expansion a goal of his presidency, announcing he wants to create 5 million new apprenticeships over the next five years, a tenfold increase, but it's uncertain how that will happen with roughly the same amount of federal spending being applied.

""One interim step to make apprenticeships more widespread is to build a better case for their economic value,"" Schneider said.

Another issue to grapple with is what some employers see as too cumbersome a process to create and maintain a registered apprenticeship program.

Trump signed an executive order in June removing federal restrictions that he says have prevented industries from expanding apprenticeship programs.

""When the process and the regulations are relaxed, we'll see more opportunity in apprenticeships,"" Lawrence said.

Certificates are nondegree credentials mostly offered by educational institutions like community colleges.

They usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge about a certain vocational or professional subject, can be completed more quickly than associate's degrees and often do not have general education requirements.

According to federal education statistics, there were roughly 960,000 certificates awarded to students in the 2014-15 academic year, a large increase from 10 years earlier.

Certificate holders were most likely to work as administrative assistants or in health care, followed by jobs in business management and operations, sales, manufacturing and farming, and grounds services.

They are most likely to earn between $20,000 and $50,000 per year, with 29 percent earning less than $20,000 and 29 percent earning more than $50,000.

Most respondents said their last postsecondary certificate was either very useful or somewhat useful in getting them a job.

An even larger percentage said the certificate program had improved their work skills, while 58 percent said it was useful in increasing their pay.

According to the Association for Career and Technical Education, certificates largely lack independent verification of the skills.

Learned, whereas certifications are expressly designed by industry groups to convey mastery of specific knowledge, skills or processes.

""Certifications are measured against a set of accepted standards, usually coupled with a formal assessment and validation designed in cooperation with a business, trade association or other industry group,"" Schneider said."
1244,Staff,12/11/2017 1:40 AM,"Uponor has developed an apprenticeship program with the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry to recruit, train and retain skilled workers in the midst of the skilled labor shortage.

The apprenticeship is a three-year program targeting maintenance department, an area where it is particularly challenging to find qualified employees.

Depending on the success of the initial program, Uponor will potentially create additional apprenticeships to further develop both internal and external talent.

""Talent shortages and skill gaps are slowing manufacturers' efforts to expand, innovate and thrive,"" says Bill Gray, president of Uponor North America.

""By developing an apprenticeship program in combination with internships, educational opportunities, and other recruitment initiatives, we hope to mitigate this widespread trend.""

According to a recent study from Deloitte Consulting LLP and the Manufacturing Institute, ""The Skills Gap in U.S. Manufacturing: 2015 and Beyond,"" there will be a shortage of two million manufacturing employees over the next decade, meaning the average U.S. manufacturer will lose 11 percent of annual earnings due to the talent shortage.

Seven in 10 manufacturing executives also report shortages of workers with adequate technical and computer skills.

Uponor's apprenticeship program was developed as part of the Minnesota Apprenticeship Initiative to expand registered apprenticeships as a workforce-development tool that combines job-related technical instruction with structured on-the-job learning experiences.

Apprenticeship Minnesota helps employers design an apprenticeship program that provides participants with specific skills, training and job-related instruction to fit the company's needs.

Ken Peterson, Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry commissioner, says, ""In all skilled occupations across Minnesota, employers are seeking solutions to train new and existing workers for today's more technical jobs. Apprenticeships can be a proactive and productive solution to address this need.""

The initial maintenance apprenticeship program at Uponor will encompass more than 6,000 hours of on-the-job training and related instruction.

Apprentices will receive training in production rotations, working at the repair/fabrication shop, HVAC repair and adjustment, troubleshooting PLCs, basic carpentry, electrical repairs, and rebuilding, installing, adjusting and troubleshooting pneumatics and hydraulics among other skills.

Related training will include ABB Robot training, Yaskawa training, and pneumatics and hydraulics training.

By the end of the program, apprentices will receive PMMI Level 2 certification and achieve Journeyman status or a Maintenance Electrical license.

Apprenticeships generally start once a student graduates from a two-year technical school, though graduates are eligible to apply for the apprenticeship for up to 18 months after they graduate.

The state has agreed to allow the second year of education for apprenticeship candidates from vetted programs, including Dunwoody College of Technology, Hennepin Tech, Dakota County Technical College, South Central Community and Technical College, Ridgewater College, St. Cloud Technical and Community College, Anoka Technical, and MN West Community and Technical College, to count for requirements for this specific apprenticeship.

This is particularly important to Uponor, which already has an internship program with Dunwoody that can be used as a pipeline for recruiting talent.

In addition to receiving support from the Minnesota Department of Labor in developing the program, Uponor will also receive a Minnesota Apprenticeship Initiative grant, through which Uponor will receive $5,000 per registered apprentice to help cover training costs."
1245,Anna Giaritelli,12/11/2017 12:25 AM,"Several states are rising to President Trump's challenge to promote apprenticeship programs as a way to fill a ""Skills gap"" in companies and reduce the unemployment rate.

Trump has been pushing blue-collar and non-collegiate jobs as opposed to his predecessor, Barack Obama, who advocated for young people to attend college.

""Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups, and unions to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high-paying careers. Instead of being racked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn - think of that: earn while they learn,"" Trump said in June.

The White House announced the apprenticeship initiative six months ago.

Trump signed an executive order promising tax breaks for participating states and grants for companies that hire apprentices or implement apprenticeship programs.

""College is not the only track to a great career,"" Labor Secretary Alex Acosta said at a Washington event in October to honor apprenticeship programs.

""I was talking to a CEO the other day who said that his company was hiring welders at an opening salary of $60,000. I thought, 'Shouldn't kids know about this?'"".

Some employers do not want to train and pay an entry-level worker who may leave following the temporary position, while workers may not be inclined to work for free or little pay and not have the possibility of receiving a full-time job in the end.

Arkansas, Kentucky, and Nevada are trying out some ways to follow through on Trump's push.

In South Carolina, the Apprenticeship Carolina program is a division of the state's technical college system.

It provides employers with consulting services on how to become certified through the national Registered Apprenticeship System.

All businesses in the state, including government agencies, are able to sponsor and register a program.

Individual businesses, including trade associations, can jointly sponsor a training committee.

That allows them to train apprentices for positions they will need in the future and gives businesses a type of ""Farm team"" to pull from.

More than 28,000 residents have completed one of the 918 programs available in the state.

Arica Carter said completing a training program through Blue Cross Blue Shield gave her a stepping stone to an information technology job.

She graduated from college with a computer engineering degree right after the 2001 dot-com bust, when the industry was struggling.

After working in civil engineering, she said the apprenticeship gave her a way to get back into the technology industry.

""I would definitely recommend applying. It opens a lot of doors for you - a lot of opportunities,"" Carter said in an advertisement for the program.

In Arkansas, employers who hire an apprentice who is 17 years old or younger can receive a tax credit of $2,000 or 10 percent of the worker's wages, whichever is less.

Other states are giving tax credits for equipment related to the apprenticeships, instead of money toward human resources.

Missouri provides tax credits of up to 30 percent of the original value of the equipment or property that is purchased.

The states' incentives are being funded by the Labor Department, whose budget for Employment Training Administration could be lower than last year's.

The House appropriated $10.8 billion, while the Senate version provided $12 billion.

The White House had proposed $9.7 billion, which is 20 percent lower than the prior year.

Jeffrey Miron, director of economic studies at the Cato Institute and director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, said the best way to get people to apply for apprenticeships would be by repealing minimum wage laws and child labor laws.

""The administration's efforts will plausibly have mild beneficial effects ... Simply because [it's] treating [the] symptom rather than really going after underlying disease,"" Miron said in an email.

A better way to address industry job shortages would be to not approve any policies that would make it difficult for businesses to hire apprentices in the first place, he said."
1260,Brent Parton,12/14/2017  1:00 AM,"?So, what are you doing next year?? It?s a common question American high school students face from teachers, neighbors, their friends, and parents. For students today, the most common answer is college, with nearly 70 percent of today?s high school graduates enrolling in higher education after graduation. While high school graduation rates are at historic high, still nearly a third of students do not enroll in postsecondary education after graduation. Of those that do, just over half will graduate with a bachelor?s degree in six years, and their prospects are worse if they start at a two-year college. Among completers, there is no guarantee of a well-paying job to help pay off the over $30,000 debt that today?s college graduates accumulate on average.

As policymakers contemplate new ways to prepare students for college and careers, youth apprenticeship stands out as a compelling option. Apprenticeship is a proven educational model that integrates on-the-job and classroom learning. Apprentices gain valuable work experience, access to professional mentors and networks, and earn postsecondary credit and credentials. From day one of the program, the apprentice is a paid employee, developing valuable skills to add productive value while on the job. To realize these potential benefits for students and employers alike, youth apprenticeship functions as a partnership across industry, high schools, and postsecondary institutions.  Compared to countries like Germany and Switzerland, youth apprenticeship is an underutilized education and workforce strategy in the U.S., but new research from New America?s Center on Education & Skills (CESNA) suggests youth apprenticeship is gaining steam in many states.

The Advanced Manufacturing Prep Training Center was unveiled during a grand opening on December 6th. in partnership with the City of Kent.

The 3,000 square foot training center offers a suite of advanced manufacturing programs geared towards local employers and job seekers alike.

This is the first training center the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee has operated to meet the needs of an industry with a growing skills gap and shortage of middle skilled workers.

""We're really here to provide the training for employers and for employers to talk to us and tell us what they need,"" said Demetria ""Lynn"" Strickland, Executive Director of AJAC. The six programs AJAC will offer include orientation and screening for job seekers, pre-apprenticeship for advanced manufacturing, entry-level and advanced apprenticeships for incumbent workers, short-term training for local employers and master mentorship courses to skill-up our current mentors on the shop floor.

""Kent's. manufacturing and industrial economy is bustling, but employers are struggling to find qualified and skilled employees,"" said Ben Wolters.

""Having AJAC open up a training facility convenient to both Kent's. diverse group of advanced manufacturers and its growing population of job seekers will help ensure Kent's. manufacturers continue to thrive and our residents continue to see new career opportunities.""

Equipment students will learn on includes a computer-numerically-controlled HAAS VF2, manual knee mills, step shear and box and pan brake, three wire feed welding units, prusa four-color 3D printer, inspection tools, and a full-service classroom.

""The Port of Seattle. is a proud sponsor of the Advanced Manufacturing Prep Training Center in Kent.,"" said Commissioner Stephanie Bowman.

""Projects like this are exactly what we had in mind when we created our Economic Development Grants, so that we can partner with cities like Kent. in order to bring jobs and economic growth to our region.""

Manufacturing jobs continue to grow, with over 31,000 added in November 2017.

The problem many employers face is vacant positions due to unqualified workers.

Vocational facilities can truly make an impact on local communities to create sustainable jobs, higher wages and low unemployment rates regionally."

What has ensued since has been a decades-long and very rewarding career. I have been a part of some of the biggest and most important construction projects in state history. In that time, I was also named to the Apprenticeship Board of Trustees. Because of my overwhelmingly positive experience, I have become a champion for bringing more women into our program. 

While progress on this front was slow but steady at first, it went to a new level with the energy renaissance that has taken flight in Pennsylvania. The country?s need for affordable and reliable energy has resulted in the need for numerous pipeline projects, world-class ethane crackers and associated infrastructure build-out, which has sparked an unprecedented workforce demand ? and with it unprecedented levels of female participation in the industry across the board.  I?m so happy to say that International Union of Operating Engineers Local 66 has some of the absolute best women running cranes, bending pipe out on pipelines and running excavators. These women have stepped up to the plate and broken that ceiling. "

1269,Michael J. Lotito And Ilyse Schuman,12/16/2017 1:02 AM,"The Trump administration's Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, released on December 14, 2017, indicates agencies are taking a hard look at existing rules, and treading lightly with new ones.

The fall regulatory agenda outlines each agency's rulemaking efforts at any stage in the process-from requests for information to final regulations-and gives estimated timelines for completion.

This information provides insight into an agency's priorities and what employers can expect in the coming months.

The fall regulatory agenda shows federal agencies are taking to heart two executive orders issued in the first few weeks of the new administration.

In January, President Trump issued Executive Order 13771: Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which requires agencies to eliminate two rules for every new one issued.

A month later, the president issued Executive Order 13777: Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda, which calls for each federal agency to develop a regulatory reform task force to identify burdensome regulations for possible repeal, replacement, or modification.

As a result, the agencies charged with implementing and enforcing labor and employment laws intend to review and either rescind or revise a number of rules drafted during the previous administration.

Notably, the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Administration will propose an updated salary level for the overtime exemption for executive, administrative and professional employees.

The WHD estimates that a notice of proposed rulemaking on this issue will be published in October 2018.

Several rules drafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration during the Obama administration are also subject to revision.

OSHA is seeking additional comments about its new standard governing occupational exposure to beryllium in certain industries.

The agency also intends to issue, soon, a proposed rule to reconsider, revise, or remove provisions of its Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses final rule, particularly as it relates to employee privacy.

Although many regulations on the agency rule list are being reconsidered, a few new proposals are in the works.

Within the month, the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration is scheduled to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish criteria for an employer group or association to act as an ""Employer"" within the meaning of section 3(5) of ERISA and sponsor an association health plan that qualifies as an employee welfare benefit plan and a group health plan under Title I of ERISA. This regulatory action is the result of Executive Order 13813: Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States, which directed the DOL to issue proposed regulations or guidance allowing more employers to form AHPs.

The order specifically references broadening the interpretation of the conditions that satisfy the commonality-of-interest requirements with respect to the definition of an ""Employer"" under ERISA. The goal of this broader interpretation is to allow trade associations, for example, to offer health insurance to employees of member companies.

It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to provide more affordable pathways to secure, high paying jobs by promoting apprenticeships and effective workforce development programs, while easing the regulatory burden on such programs and reducing or eliminating taxpayer support for ineffective workforce development programs.

To that end, the DOL's Employment and Training Administration will propose regulations ""To establish the framework for industry-recognized apprenticeship programs, a new industry-led initiative to promote innovation and opportunity in apprenticeship, and integrate this initiative with the existing Registered Apprenticeship system."" The regulatory agenda indicates this proposed rule will be issued during January 2018.

A complete list of the items on the DOL's regulatory agenda can be found here.

In its statement of regulatory priorities, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission noted that by the end of January 2018, it will issue a proposed rule to revise its procedural regulations under Title VII, the ADA, GINA, and the ADEA ""To allow for electronic transmissions, to clarify the deferral process to state and local agencies, to update no cause determination procedures.""

The EEOC will take a second look at its wellness regulations in light of the ruling of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in AARP v. EEOC, in which the court invalidated, but did not vacate, the EEOC's final regulations on the operation of voluntary wellness programs under the ADA and GINA. Proposed changes to these wellness regulations are expected in August 2018.

Other items on the EEOC's regulatory agenda can be found here.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services considers changes to the H-1B nonimmigrant program and petitioning process regulations a priority for 2018.

In order to improve U.S. worker protections as well as to address the requirements of Executive Order 13788, Buy American and Hire American, USCIS proposes to issue regulations with the focus of improving the H-1B nonimmigrant program and petitioning process.

Such initiatives include a proposed rule that would establish an electronic registration program for H-1B petitions subject to annual numerical limitations and would improve the H-1B numerical limitation allocation process .... and a proposed rule that would revise the definition of specialty occupation to increase focus on truly obtaining the best and brightest foreign nationals via the H-1B program and would revise the definition of employment and employer-employee relationship to help better protect U.S. workers and wages.

A proposed rule on the registration requirement is slated for February 2018.

Proposed changes to revise the definition of specialty occupation are scheduled for an October 2018 release.

Other immigration-related rulemaking can be found here.

The timelines in the regulatory agenda are estimates, so it is possible a rule could be issued before or after the listed date.

We will continue to monitor federal agency activity and report on significant developments."
1271,Brittany King,12/16/2017 5:58 AM,"According to Gov. Eric Holcomb, there are almost 100,000 vacant jobs across the state; but this isn't because there isn't anyone to fill them.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Indiana's unemployment rate is at 3.9 percent, slightly lower than the country's 4.1 percent rate.

These jobs are vacant because Hoosiers aren't prepared to enter the industries these jobs are available in.

In November, he announced the creation of a new state agency: The Office of Apprenticeship.

Throughout Holcomb's term, this office will ensure that high school students aren't just being shown colleges to consider upon graduation, but that they are also being introduced to alternative possibilities.

A traditional program consists of 144 hours of class time and 2,000 hours of job training.

The time it takes to complete an apprenticeship can vary, but apprenticeships involving building trades and industrial programs - the most popular options in Indiana - take four to five years to complete.

Upon completion, an apprentice will walk away with multiple credentials, certification from the Department of Labor, a journeyperson card and an associate degree for little to no cost, as most employers cover the cost of these programs.

Currently, many Indiana high school curriculums encourage students to seek post-secondary education and do little to help students who don't believe college is for them.

Devon Doss, executive director of Indiana Plan - a nonprofit that prepares minorities and disadvantaged workers to enter apprenticeships - experienced this when he was a student.

""A lot of young people think they have to choose college or the military, and if that doesn't work they just go find a job somewhere. Indiana Plan shows them that they can have a career,"" he said.

Doss participated in Indiana Plan in 1995 and has worked as a union electrician for 19 years.

Created in 1970, Indiana Plan was born out of an executive order given by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.

The executive order mandated that discriminatory practices would no longer be allowed when hiring contractors.

The order also required large construction companies to implement affirmative action plans.

Indiana Plan helps apprenticeship programs in Indianapolis and Gary diversify their applicant pools.

The organization hosts a free two-week crash course on apprenticeships that includes info about construction safety, money management and basic math skills.

The organization also helps Hoosiers get certifications to set their apprentice application apart.

At the end of the course, Indiana Plan reaches out to its network of apprenticeship programs to alert them of the new crop of students looking for work.

In the last three years, every student that has gone through the program has been offered a job.

In November, Ivy Tech Community College became a Department of Labor-approved apprenticeship sponsor to aid in the governor's goal of increasing the number of skilled workers.

""We are working hand-in-hand with the Department of Labor to make this work,"" said Teresa Hess, executive director of apprenticeship studies at Ivy Tech.

""The college will now take on the administration challenges that companies often face. To register a company, there is some paperwork involved and you have to track apprenticeship hours. By us becoming a sponsor, that's one of the things that will be eliminated from the company. This will especially help the smaller companies who may not have the capacity within their HR departments to complete the paperwork.""

This new model is currently being piloted in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with plans for it to roll out across the state in the spring.

Through the new partnership, Ivy Tech is hoping to expand in non-traditional apprenticeship areas like health care and IT. For decades, the college has worked with industries in Indiana to aid in the apprenticeship process and to date has awarded over 13,000 apprenticeship degrees.

Apprenticeships have proven to be beneficial to the workforce and the economy.

According to Ivy Tech, these programs reduce turnover, create a pipeline for skilled workers, increase competitive edge and ensure workers are trained to industry specifications.

""It's a win-win situation for the employers and employees,"" Hess said.

""It's not a job; it's a career path, and it's a high-paying, good career. I'm very excited that the state is taking strides to make apprenticeships more prevalent across Indiana."""
1272,Staff,12/16/2017 7:47 AM,"Over the last decades, many American inner cities have seen an economic resurgence.

Buoyed by millennials and people's desire to shorten their daily work commute, neighborhoods and communities that were all but pronounced dead two decades ago now find themselves flush with new businesses and residents.

This is no more evident than here in the District of Columbia, where the economic recovery of the city has been nothing short of breathtaking.

As many have noted, this growth has not been equally beneficial to all residents.

While policymakers and advocates search for answers and solutions to this problem, there is one time-tested and proven tool that should be a key part of any workforce development strategy-apprenticeships.

Introduced in the 14th century, apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction, teaching workers the practical and theoretical aspects of highly skilled occupations.

Employers, labor groups, or employer associations can sponsor apprenticeship programs.

Traditional apprenticeship programs have been primarily relegated to labor fields, such as carpentry or pipefitting, but there are a growing number of companies offering them in high skill/high wage fields, such as IT and engineering.

While we understand that the wage and employment gaps cannot be completely closed until the educational and systematic inequalities in this country are addressed, strong apprenticeship programs can help bridge the gap between the shortcoming of our education system and job readiness for high wage sectors.

Urban policymakers should make a strong investment in funding apprenticeship programs that help those from their most underserved communities enter into career fields with strong earnings and growth.

By providing strong hands on training in high wage/high growth fields, such as tech or entrepreneurship, policymakers can help residents who may not have received adequate educational preparation build key job skills and find stable employment.

In a political environment where big initiatives can often be hard to implement, apprenticeship programs have long had bipartisan support.

The U.S. Department of Labor reports that over 91percent of all apprentices retain employment upon completion of their apprenticeship.

Here, in the District of Columbia, we have committed to increasing the number of registered apprenticeships through our Apprenticeship DC initiative.

In September of this year, we awarded approximately $400,000 in grants to local businesses and community-based organizations that target the IT, construction, and infrastructure industries.

Apprenticeship DC promotes both pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship work-based learning models.

Over the next year, we will work with local business owners and community advocates to build upon this effort and target resources to maximize the number of apprenticeships available for our communities.

Through this initiative and the D.C. Infrastructure Academy, we hope to prove to.

Washingtonians that we are committed to ensuring that all District residents are able to participate in District's growing economy.

As officials and policymakers in other urban areas deal with their own economic gaps, I hope that they will take a look at what we have done here in the District with our apprenticeship programs and embrace this model as a strong workforce development tool.

Odie Donald II is director of the DC Department of Employment Services."
1274,Staff,12/18/2017 3:36 PM,"South Dakota governor Dennis Daugaard announces a new SDPASS initiative that will offer students different options to find a career in cyber security, or network security and administration.

South Dakota needs more cyber security experts, and four groups are working together to make that career path more widely available.

Dakota State University, Southeast Technical Institute, the Sioux Falls School District and the Department of Labor and Regulation are teaming up for an initiative they're calling ""South Dakota Partnership for Student Success"" or SDPASS.""We need to have more opportunities, more pathways,"" said Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who helped announce the new partnership at a press conference Monday afternoon at Southeast Tech.It's in the early stages now, but the hope is SDPASS will offer students different options to find a career in cyber security, or network security and administration.

DSU President Josu00e9-Marie Griffiths said the ""Pass"" acronym is meant to play on the ""Pass"" as the opposite of ""Fail,"" but she also called upon the flexibility of bus passes, where there are a number of different entry points.

""That's the kind of notion we're building here,"" Griffiths said Monday.

""You can come on and start an apprenticeship, your apprenticeship will count toward an associate degree.""

Apprenticeship opportunities through SDPASS are expected to be available in the fall of 2018.More: Cyber security programs surge as hacks take national stage.

The focus on cyber security is in direct response to business needs in Sioux Falls, Griffiths said.

""I don't know any organization that doesn't have some need in the area of cyber security, not just industry but government, nonprofits,"" she said.

DSU and Southeast Tech already have several options for people looking to earn a tech-related degree, including bachelor's degrees, associate programs and academic certificates in various areas.

SDPASS aims to expand those options beyond the traditional college path to high school students, people looking to change careers and high school graduates who do not enroll directly in college.

This will be possible through increased internship and registered apprenticeship programs, Griffiths said.

DSU has been working with Sioux Falls K-12 public schools for a while now, said Sioux Falls Superintendent Brian Maher, but SDPASS is adding more urgency to those conversations about preparing students for the workforce of the future.

It's not fully clear what role Sioux Falls schools will play in the partnership, Maher said, but he imagines it will hinge on professional development and curriculum.

""We need to move from rhetoric to reality,"" Maher said.

Business partners have already begun to sign on in addition to the four public entities.

Sanford, Avera, Citibank, First Premier Bank and others have voiced support for the effort, Griffiths said.

At the end of the day, it's about increasing opportunities, she added.

""It's really a partnership to allow for multiple pathways into the workforce by providing a range of different educational opportunities that people can pick up over time,"" Griffiths said."

1286,Rob Christensen,12/21/2017  4:01 PM,"Here is one topic you can safely talk about with your family over the holidays without fear of World War III breaking out.  At a time when employers are talking about the shortage of skilled workers, when students are stuck with growing college loan debts, and when there is often a mismatch between the skill sets the students are learning and those needed in the workplace, there is increasing interest in apprenticeships.

Apprenticeships are those programs where students combine paid, on-the-job-learning with classroom instruction, completing the program with work experience and no student debt.  The subject is not as familiar as other routes of education.  But apprenticeships hold special promise in North Carolina, a state where many areas have had difficulty recovering from the Great Recession ? where traditional jobs in manufacturing have not come back."
1288,Lolade Fadulu,12/21/2017 11:41 AM,"During the last big wave of automation in the 1980s and 1990s, technology produced new jobs and made others obsolete.

The demand for rote-labor workers had diminished, while that for workers with computer-based skills had gone up.

Laborers who didn't have much experience beyond their rote jobs were, in turn, hit the hardest, and those laborers tended to be black: ""Even before the economic restructuring of the nation's economy,"" wrote William Julius Wilson in his 1996 book When Work Disappears, ""Low-skilled African-Americans were at the end of the employment queue."" Who will the biggest victims be in this new age of automation, in which artificial intelligence dominates and tasks such as driving are computerized?

As Bryon Auguste-the CEO and co-founder of Opportunity at Work, an organization that connects low-income people to jobs-said on a Brookings Institution panel earlier this month, it doesn't ""Naturally empower the top of the economic pyramid."" Nor, he argued, is automation like gravity-a force of nature that can't be stopped.

Humans have control over how technology is spread and implemented across industries-and they're driven by what Auguste described as ""Economic incentives"" and ""Cultural assumptions."" These incentives and assumptions indirectly determine automation's impact on the workforce.

In this new wave, Latinos are the main casualties.

Americans favor assigning to robots jobs that are dangerous and unhealthy for humans rather than those that require human sensibilities, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center.

Latinos, especially Latino men, are heavily overrepresented in those challenging, and oftentimes repetitive, roles.

The top 20 most popular occupations among Latinos virtually all involve hard, manual work and are often dangerous, according to the Brookings Institution fellows Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton, citing jobs in agriculture, roofing, and construction specifically.

Construction, for example, had the most fatal work injuries among the Bureau of Labor statistics categories.

Latinos make up a whopping 63 percent of drywall installers, a dangerous job because of the harmful irritants in drywall dust, while 30 percent are white and 7 percent are African American, according to Muro and Whiton's calculations.

Latinos are also overrepresented in repetitive work that requires few digital skills-such as that in hospitality-and, according to research by the Mckinsey Global Institute, is most susceptible to automation using currently available technologies.

Automation in the aforementioned sectors has already begun.

That's in part because many of them have lots of job openings that employers could eliminate using robots and other technology, whose efficiency and productivity would also save the companies money in the long-term.

Drones can take inventory on a site faster than humans can.

The automation of jobs such as drywall installation and roofing is also appealing because the positions are so dangerous: Replacing humans with robots in those jobs could prevent countless injuries and save lives.

All this suggests that the current workforce-automation trend is beneficial not only for the economy, but also for the workers in those jobs-provided that those laborers can develop the new, relatively advanced digital skills required to manage the machines or find other decent-wage jobs.

The problem is that few Latinos seem to have these opportunities.

According to the Pew report, Latinos are far more likely than whites and blacks to cite automation as the key cause for why their hours or pay have been reduced, or even why they lost a job.

While the construction sector has many openings, for example, sometimes those openings are in new areas to which displaced workers can't travel, as my colleague Alanna Semuels has pointed out in her reporting.

In an effort to gauge the impact of automation on different racial groups, the Brookings Institution's Muro and Whiton assessed the ""Automation potential""-a measure developed by McKinsey that pertains to how many tasks can be automated using today's technology-for the 20 occupations in which each racial group is most concentrated.

They then compared that to the number of workers in each occupation.

Latinos, the researchers found, face the highest automation potential at close to 60 percent, followed by blacks at 50 percent, Asians at almost 40 percent, and whites at roughly 25 percent.

Without digital skills, Latinos can be automated out of jobs that extend far beyond the construction and hospitality sectors: According to Brookings, the share of jobs that don't require workers to have experience beyond basic digital skills-such as knowing how to use Excel and Word-has fallen from 56 to 30 percent between 2002 to 2012.Proposals to tax robots and automation, among other efforts, seek to curtail the spread of new technologies.

Assuming those attempts are unsuccessful, creating more education opportunities that target Latinos could help improve their employment prospects.

Entrenched school and housing segregation means that Latinos have far less access than whites to resources that determine their longer-term education and job trajectories, largely by influencing who gets what skills early on-who, for example, gets the schooling that allows her to pursue a computer science degree at MIT and who gets the schooling that all but limits her to a job in housekeeping.

Latinos have a higher high-school dropout rate-at 10 percent-than their black, whites, and Asian peers, in large part because they tend to pool their resources together to have one household income, said Jaime Dominguez, a political-science and Latino-studies professor at Northwestern University, alluding to the fact that so many Latino families are low-income.

""There is an obligation to work.""

Training and education programs that focus on teaching participants the digital skills they need to thrive in the current economy will have to ensure that those participants can earn while they learn.

Certain initiatives, such as Pathways 2 Apprenticeship, focus on African-Americans, Latinos, and other disadvantaged people of color namely because they are more likely to be low-income than whites.

Automation threatens to exacerbate a pattern in which Latinos are stuck at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder: In depriving them of jobs-and often pushing them into the devastating cycle of long-term unemployment, the trend will make it increasingly difficult for low-income Latinos to enter the middle class.

Few resources have been dedicated to ameliorating the trend's impact on the demographic's workforce.

The most recent federal-job training program, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act of 2014, which President Obama signed in 2014 in an effort to improve the employment prospects of working Americans, has specific provisions for Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals in recognition of those groups' unique disadvantages.

Doubts about the merits of federal job-training initiatives aside, it's worth noting that the act does little to explicitly target supports for Latinos."

On Dec. 27, the band will livestream an ambitious 24-hour performance to raise money for its new EP and awareness about one of their favorite charities.

Half of the livestream's proceeds will go to Apprenticeship and Non-Traditional Employment for Women, a nonprofit that sets women up with the training they need to get family wage careers in the non-traditional, male-dominated industries, especially in construction.

""Gender inequality and women's rights kept coming up, but this [is] the first charity that we looked at that felt reallypractical as a means of increasing gender equality in the workplace,"" said Mojo's percussionist and singer Heather Thomas.

""And ANEW stuck out to us because they provide apprenticeships and training for building jobs, construction, electricity; any job related to the construction industries.""

According to the United States Department of Labor, only about 9 percent of construction workers are women.

ANEW hopes to change that by providing women with quality training, employment navigation and supportive services that can lead them to satisfying family-wage careers in the construction industry.

ANEW's work strikes a chord with Thomas, and it makes sense.

During college, she worked a summer job building fiberglass hydroplanes.

""I really loved working on the boats, it was super fulfilling, but I was the only woman,"" she recalls.

1292,Jeffrey J. Selingo By,12/22/2017 10:53 PM,"When President Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to substantially increase apprenticeships in the United States, he joined a line of recent presidents who have tried to reimagine job training as something that happens on the job instead of mostly in a classroom.

Despite this focus at the highest levels of government, apprenticeships have never caught on in the United States compared to many European countries.

Today, American apprenticeships remain largely associated with the construction trades and labor unions, where they had their roots in a Depression-era labor shortage that led Congress to pass formalized standards and empowered the Labor Department to certify training.

Last year, about 500,000 apprentices were listed with 21,000 programs on the Department of Labor's registry.

While that's up from fewer than 400,000 just four years ago, it's still far short of demand and pales in comparison to the 2 million new students who enroll in community colleges every year.

Apprenticeships are receiving renewed attention partly because the primary pathway into the job market - the college degree - has led some graduates to struggle in finding work and facing large amounts of student-loan debt.

Some 91 percent of apprentices find employment after completing their programs, with a starting pay of more than $51,000 annually.

What's more, most of them leave their programs without any debt, compared to the average college graduate last year who borrowed to finance their education and left campus $37,000 in the hole.

""What most people don't understand is that apprenticeships are like college but without the debt,"" said Eleni Papadakis, executive director of the Washington state Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board, at a panel discussion on apprenticeships that I moderated earlier this month at the think tank New America.

""In most cases, apprentices still earn college credits and degrees, and then end up in good jobs.""

The reasons why fewer than 2 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds in this country are enrolled in apprenticeships are varied and complex, and many can't be easily fixed with executive orders from the White House.

The biggest issue is cultural: The ""College-for-all"" movement in the United States over the last four decades has pushed many youth to campuses even when they weren't ready or didn't want to follow that well-trod pathway.

Take Michael Shinn, whom I met in North Carolina while reporting my book on the difficult transition today's youth face in this job market.

Michael had good grades in high school, especially in math, and had completed several AP courses.

So his high school counselor encouraged him to follow the college route, and he had plans to major in engineering at North Carolina State University.

In the spring of his junior year he noticed a sign for an apprenticeship program run by local manufacturers.

Shinn went to the presentation the following week, although he told me he was discouraged from doing so by his counselor.

""He told me I was college-going material and this wasn't for me,"" Shinn recalled.

The companies were nothing like the blue-collar, assembly-line jobs his generation associates with factory work.

These were advanced operations with a desperate need for workers who could actually think, and not just make widgets.

The best part was they would pay him to work and go to school, and they guaranteed a job after the four-year apprenticeship.

When I caught up with him a few years after his apprenticeship ended, he had already completed an associate's degree at a nearby community college, paid for by Ameritech Die & Mold, where he started work making custom tools at $35,000 a year.

He told me his wife, who had recently completed her MBA, was finding the job market difficult.

""Teachers and guidance counselors only talk about college as the way to a good life,"" he told me.

""I wish more of them could see what I do every day. I don't have a mindless manufacturing job.""

Programs like the one Shinn completed in North Carolina have perhaps the best chance at success because they work with local employers and the skills they need in a region.

It is states, and not the federal government, that have been the leader in building apprenticeships in recent years.

The biggest effort of this kind is in Colorado, where Gov. John Hickenlooper wants to make apprenticeships as common as going to college.

Backed by nearly $10 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies and JPMorgan Chase, Colorado has started offering hands-on training, beginning in high school, in financial services, information technology, health care and manufacturing.

The goal is to make the program available to some 20,000 students within the next decade.

In its report on apprenticeships earlier this month, New America suggested several ways the federal government could be supportive of state efforts, including better connecting the higher education system and apprenticeships, and allowing federal work-study funds to cover tuition and fees of student apprentices.

It's unclear whether apprenticeships will ever become as ubiquitous as college in the United States or as they are in Europe, where it's not unusual to find top executives of companies who started as apprentices.

There can't just be one pathway into good-paying jobs from high school in the United States, because as recent history shows us, that pathway is littered with students who never complete a degree and others who graduate with too much debt and little prospect for gainful employment."
1293,Associated Press,12/24/2017 11:22 AM,"MADISON, Wis. - An agricultural apprenticeship program that began in Wisconsin in 2010 has spread to 10 states and is registered with the U.S. Department of Labor.

The Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship partners experienced farmers with beginners, Wisconsin Public Radio reported.

More than half of today's farmers are over the age of 55, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Census of Agriculture.

The mentorship program aims to encourage more young people to enter the industry as older farmers retire.

The program requires new farmers to complete a certain number of on-the-job training hours while checking off certain lessons in a workbook.

The experienced farmers pay their students a salary and some offer bonus incentives, such as offering equity in the farm or a future transfer of the farm's ownership.

Joe Tomandl founded the program and said it's based on classic guild apprenticeships.

""We're trying to figure out, how can we bring more farms back onto the landscape?"" Tomandl said.

""How can we create more opportunities for independent business people to fulfill their dreams and aspirations and get on a dairy?"".

Farming knowledge used to be passed on through families over generations, no more, Tomandl said.

""I mean, we just are not seeing the sons and daughters that are interested in coming back to the dairy. So, much of that transition of knowledge is not happening,"" Tomandl said.

""But there are enough people outside family looking at coming into dairy someday. So that's where this formal process is important.""

Scott Mericka, co-owner of Grass Dairy and Uplands Cheese Company, is mentoring Matt Nielsen through the program.

Nielsen will undergo 4,000 hours of training during the two-year program.

""I am a person who asks a ton of questions, like 400 questions a day,"" said Nielsen.

""But Scott is so patient with me. He almost rarely says, 'I don't know,' which is something I appreciate with his vast bank of knowledge."""
1294,Amie Steffen,12/24/2017 7:19 AM,"CEDAR FALLS - The starting wages for many of the jobs right out of high school: more than double the minimum wage.

The schooling: free - and you could even get paid to sit in a classroom.

""When you think about opportunity costs and what's starting wage, that's a really good deal,"" said Ethan Wiechmann, a lead instructor at Cedar Falls High School's Center for Advanced Professional Studies, or CAPS. Wiechmann, other instructors and a panel of business owners were addressing a group of about 60 Cedar Falls High School students, mostly upperclassmen, on the benefits of apprentice training during the Skilled Trades Career Fair on Wednesday afternoon in the school's choir room.

""They'll train you for free. They'll pay you while you're doing it,"" said Nate Clayberg, a CAPS business liaison.

""Sounds like a no-brainer to me.""

Business owners at places like Dalton Plumbing and Heating, PCI, Croell and K and W Electric were on hand to introduce themselves and the jobs they offered to the dozens of students.

Most of the students had already shown an interest in the high school industrial technology curriculum, and more than a few weren't sure if they wanted to attend a four-year college, something Koch Construction founder Jeff Koch said applied to himself as well.

""I just barely got out of this building in 1979,"" he told the students.

Instead, Koch said he valued other skills - skills the students were already learning in shop class, skills that make a good construction worker.

""If you're good with your hands, we've got a place for you,"" Koch said.

Many employers said, as long as a student was 18, they could begin training or working with them right away.

OSHA regulations specify only adults can work with most types of machinery.

Students also could choose to start some type of schooling either before or during their apprenticeship period with a company.

""You do one day in the classroom and four days working, so you're making money while you're doing it,"" said Loren Gardner with the Blackhawk School of Apprenticeship in Waterloo.

""You can also just come to the school, and we will find you a job.""

Students had a chance to speak one-on-one with several of the employers at booths the businesses had set up in the hallway after the presentation, which most students took advantage of - even if graduation was more than a year away.

""I wanted to get information and see what's out there,"" said junior Brock Azbill.

That was the whole idea, said CFHS guidance counselor Chris Wood, who noted it was the second year the school has held a career fair and attendance had doubled.

""The idea is to get them thinking about what's next,"" Wood said.

""These employers are gung-ho to hire right now.""

Walt Jackson, a project manager with PCI, said he was hopeful businesses like his could have more opportunities in more high schools in the area in the future.

""We're always looking for people - the construction industry is always growing by leaps and bounds,"" Jackson said."
1297,Press Release,12/26/2017  10:18 AM,"Phaze Concrete has led the concrete and construction industries for over a decade. While their work became recognized across the country, it's the way they have treated their employees that is turning heads.  In 2016, the company partnered with the Department of Labor?s Department of Apprenticeships. This partnership created an exciting and unique education work program that was first in the area.  The program has been hugely successful, helping many potential employees earn a quality education. The importance of this type of apprenticeship program became highlighted by Alexander Acosta, United States Secretary of Labor. He attended the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers Meeting in May 2017, where he echoed the support of the program.

The White House Office of American Innovation has become equally committed to encouraging and supporting apprenticeships across the country. The department hopes to increase the number of quality apprenticeships that are available to young workers in the United States. This mission is critical in the construction sector, which has been emerging with high growth potential.  The Phaze Concrete program is one of some 37,000 different programs sponsors offered around the country. The company has become thoroughly dedicated to ensuring that proper training becomes provided and top quality."
1300,Topic,12/26/2017 1:02 PM,"In celebration of National Apprenticeship Week, November 13-19, 2017, President Trump proclaimed, ""We recognize the important role apprenticeships play in unleashing the American workforce. Americans are known for our remarkable productivity, industriousness, and innovative thinking. By pairing these valued traits with the right training, our nation can renew one of our greatest assets-the American worker."" As talent development professionals, we can understand why apprenticeships offer a fantastic opportunity for experiential learning in the workplace.

According to the United States Department of Labor, ""Apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and related instruction in which workers learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a highly skilled occupation. Apprenticeship programs can be sponsored by individual employers, joint employer and labor groups, and/or employer associations.""

Registered Apprenticeship programs meet the skilled workforce needs of American industry, and have trained millions of qualified individuals for lifelong careers since 1937.

Registered Apprenticeship helps mobilize America's workforce with structured, on-the-job learning in traditional industries such as construction and manufacturing, as well as emerging industries such as healthcare, information technology, energy, and telecommunications.

Registered Apprenticeship connects job seekers looking to learn new skills with employers looking for qualified workers, resulting in a workforce with industry-driven training and employers with a competitive edge.

Although efforts to create and sustain an internal or company-sponsored apprenticeship should certainly be applauded, Registered Apprenticeship brings added benefits.

Skilled workers trained to industry or employer specifications to produce quality results.

Reduced worker compensation costs due to an emphasis on safety training.

Portable credentials recognized nationally and often globally.

An increased competitive edge in the global economy.

A system to contribute to and sustain economic growth.

The Apprentice School uses a competency-based model that includes on-the-job training, related academic instruction, and opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities.

All apprentices are employees of Newport News Shipbuilding from day one, working a 40-hour week that includes on-the-job training and related academic instruction.

Apprentices are paid for all work, including time spent in related academic classes.

Apprentices earn $17.34 an hour when they begin and receive pay increases throughout their apprenticeship.

Apprentices also receive traditional benefits including health insurance, vacation, paid holidays, and more.

The Apprentice School's on-the-job training approach utilizes craft instructors, all of whom are graduates of the school, to help apprentices develop the craftsmanship and core leadership principles necessary for a successful shipbuilding career.

Specifically, craft instructors ensure apprentices receive the appropriate training, document apprentices' skill development, and provide apprentices with regular, value-added evaluations.

Craft instructors also deliver a trade-related education curriculum that provides apprentices with the knowledge and skills needed to support their on-the-job training and success.

The related academic instruction apprentices receive, delivered by the school's academic faculty and partnering institutions, prepares apprentices for work in their respective shipbuilding disciplines, continuing their education in one of the school's advanced programs and furthering their education beyond apprenticeship.

Through partnerships with Thomas Nelson Community College, Tidewater Community College, and Old Dominion University, the Apprentice School provides apprentices with opportunities to earn associate degrees in business administration, engineering, engineering technology, and technical studies, and bachelor's degrees in mechanical or electrical engineering and modeling and simulation.

The school also maintains articulation agreements with several other colleges and universities.

Apprentices become leaders on the job, in the classroom, and by participating in extracurricular activities-specifically, focusing on the Apprentice School's leadership principles: commitment, improvement, respect, teamwork, empowerment, communication, planning, and decision making.

Graduates of the school are well prepared to continue Newport News Shipbuilding's long-standing tradition of building, overhauling, and maintaining the most complex and powerful naval vessels in the world."

In a joint effort between Blackhawk Technical College (BTC) and the Southwest Wisconsin Workforce Development Board (SWWDB), with support from sponsoring employers including Bell Laboratories, Miniature Precision Components, Pratt Industries, Scot Forge, Seneca Foods Corp. and Emmi Roth USA, Inc., a new Mechatronics Apprenticeship has been created as part of BTC?s academic offerings starting in January 2018.  ?Apprenticeships have applicability in every sector of the economy,? said Dr. Tracy Pierner, Blackhawk President. ?We are thrilled that our employer partners and the Southwest Wisconsin Development Board wanted to help create a great training opportunity for some of our region?s technicians.?

Designed to train electrical, mechanical and electronics systems technicians, the new Mechatronics Apprenticeship requires a five-year commitment where students complete 24 college credit hours and 872 hours of related instruction as part of a 10,000 hour training regimen.  Building on national support to expand apprenticeships, the SWWDB helped secure a Wisconsin Apprenticeship Growth and Enhancement Strategies (WAGE$) grant to help get the new Mechatronics Apprenticeship started.  ?Employers considering apprenticeships to right skill their teams are opening doors to the future of workforce training, said Rhonda Suda, Southwest Workforce Development Board Executive Director. ?The work and learn model is an investment that produces a quick return. Apprenticeships cannot move forward without employer input and buy-in so this is a great start to establishing Mechatronics Apprenticeships all over the state.?"

1305,Andrew Theen The Oreg,12/27/2017 1:18 PM,"Frankie Crispen Jr. had a lot to look forward to this past November.

On his final break the night of Nov. 17 at the Columbia Forest Products mill in Klamath Falls, Crispen texted his fiancu00e9e Ashley Albers, as he always did, teasing out the answers to his 11-year-old, soon-to-be stepdaughter's math homework.

The 28-year-old's death in the final hours of a swing shift made him Oregon's 68th workplace fatality of 2017, according to preliminary figures from the state's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

At least six more people have died on the job since Crispen fell into a vat of scalding liquid that November night.

More than half the estimated 74 workplace fatalities in 2017 thus far occurred from natural causes, according to state estimates.

State safety leaders say they don't place much significance on single-year tallies because workplace fatalities have dropped significantly over time.

Michael Wood, the state's administrator for workplace health and safety programs, said the stories behind dozens of deaths go untold each year.

Despite significant advancements in workplace safety in the past two decades and a lower fatality rate despite a significantly larger workforce, he worries that death rates are merely leveling off ""At best.""

Crispen's grisly death shocked friends, family and colleagues in Klamath Falls, a community of 21,500 just north of the Oregon-California border.

Though all workplace fatalities must be reported to the state within eight hours, the agency does not investigate all deaths.

Compounding the heartache of a life cut short, Crispen's family is struggling with the lack of information.

""It was like some lives have value and some don't,"" said Marc Waits, Crispen's brother.

Crispen usually got home from work at 10:45 p.m., some 15 minutes after clocking out.

The dispatcher had summoned emergency workers to ""a possible confined space rescue"" on the back side of the 18-acre mill on U.S. 97.

Fire crews were the first to arrive, followed by Klamath County sheriff's deputies at 11:06 p.m. By that time, Sheriff Chris Kaber said in an email, Crispen ""Had not been seen for a couple of hours.""

Albers started calling and texting when Crispen didn't arrive home at his normal time, but her calls went straight to voicemail.

Crispen's phone charger and other personal items were still inside.

She later learned that Crispen had fallen through the lid and into an in-ground vat filled with a corrosive liquid heated to 170 degrees, which is used to soften logs before they are processed into plywood.

According to the state medical examiner, Crispen died from ""Thermal injuries and caustic burns.""

Failing to find him, Albers returned home and resumed calling Crispen's cell, dialing over and over as her daughter slept in a room nearby.

Crispen was 21 years younger than his oldest sibling, Vikki Waits.

Crispen was born without a left eardrum and got harassed as a kid because he frequently sported head bandages from the various medical procedures he endured, his mother said.

From an early age, Moyette said, Crispen was surrounded by older siblings and adults.

Crispen liked doing things with his hands, and enrolled in a two-year mechanic's program at Klamath Community College.

Crispen and Albers met at the National Fitness and Racquet Club in town.

Despite his demanding full-time job at the mill, Crispen had recently taken a second job at a local GNC, a health and nutritional supplements retailer.

Shane Jones, the store's manager and a personal trainer, said Crispen was genuinely nice and incredibility physically fit.

Jim Johnston, who owns the fitness club where Crispen occasionally worked out, has set up a scholarship in the 28-year-old's name.

Johnston, who plans to sponsor a free membership each year in his honor, said Crispen was a passionate and positive force for fitness in town.

Albers and Crispen's family say they're struggling to understand how he fell into the vat.

Columbia Forest Products, which declined an interview for this report, would not say whether Crispen was working alone when he died.

Crispen had completed more than 8,000 hours of on-the-job training as of Sept. 26, according to a state spokesman, and had 576 hours of classroom instruction.

""The Apprenticeship and Training Division has no record of approving Mr. Crispen for indirect supervision related to electrical apprenticeship activity,"" the state said in an email.

According to one mill employee who declined to be identified because of the ongoing state safety investigation, the mill did right by its employees by giving all 300 workers a paid week off after Crispen's death.

In addition to the investigation following Crispen's death, there is a separate state inspection related to several safety complaints filed anonymously on Nov. 20, three days after the incident.

The complaint cites several safety concerns, including a ""Lack of training on safety issues"" for all employees and a workplace environment where staffers are ""Required to work at positions beyond their capacities, creating an unsafe work environment.""

""CFP strongly rejects any contention that it fails to adequately train employees on safety issues or that it requires employees to work outside their capacities in an unsafe manner. CFP is proud of its strong safety training program, which it has worked to develop over the course of many years, and works diligently to ensure the safety of its employees,"" the company said.

Industry and education leaders think apprenticeships could help close the skills gap. West Michigan community colleges are among those aligning themselves with the movement, and promoting the programs as another option for students.

Michigan's first accredited apprenticeship program for medical assistants launched its first cohort in 2016 to meet a pressing need in the region's health care workforce.  In November, the state announced the program was recognized as a national Promising Practice by the U.S. Department of Labor for helping health care providers fill a critical shortage of talent.  ""While we build Michigan's talent pipeline we are proud to have proactive partners, and appreciate that the U.S. Department of Labor named the West Michigan partnership a Promising Practice,'' said Roger Curtis, director of the Michigan Department of Talent and Economic Development."
1309,Robert Levey News@seacoastonline.com,12/3/2017 5:24 AM,"In part two of this two-part series, apprenticeships and internships are examined at area businesses as well as the rationale behind their implementation.

PORTSMOUTH - With a booming economy and several industries straining to find qualified job candidates, many businesses are offering apprenticeships and internships to address current and future workforce needs.

Dennis Lucia, field operation manager at Methuen Construction in Plaistow, said the firm has implemented a registered, work-based and federally recognized apprenticeship program that meets national standards with a field and learning portion.

""The educational courses are either self-taught, guided by a textbook and followed up with assistance from the company, or students are enrolled in classes at the Greater Lawrence Technical School for a more structured classroom educational program,"" he said.

He said all learning tracks include a field portion of work where ""Teammates"" are mentored by a trade journeyman on the jobsite.

""They assist with educating teammates on the variety of skills required for their trade, safety requirements, equipment necessary for completion of different tasks, and the quality needed for the finish product,"" he said.

At Artisan Electrical Contractors in Madbury, owner Al Lawrence said he employs roughly one apprentice per licensed electrician.

""Apprenticeship has a rich history - that's how people learned back in the day,"" he said.

""You would learn on the job, and I think there are incredible benefits to that kind of learning.""

Aside from providing apprentices with hands-on learning opportunities in the field, Lawrence said his program as well as that of many other companies also compensate them for their time.

""If it's just a job, you will only focus on what you are earning, but an apprenticeship helps you to re-frame it... If you put someone into an environment where you encourage them to learn. Sure, they will make tons of mistakes, but you are creating a positive dynamic.""

Aside from attracting potential long-term employees through his apprenticeship program, he said he himself receives a tangible benefit in return.

""They are performing work that has a value,"" Lawrence said.

""We are making money from them. It's a working model.""

According to Lucia, apprenticeships and internships provide important opportunities for less experienced people to learn a trade and accompanying skills while ""On the job.""

""We can provide them with instant feedback and bump up their pay as they learn new skills. That less experienced person is our future.""

Acknowledging the workforce development challenges in New Hampshire are particularly acute given the state's small population, Will Arvelo, president of Great Bay Community College, said collaboration across multiple sectors of industry and education is needed.

""We are doing a better job at figuring this all out, but it is still not where it needs to be,"" he said.

""There are a lot of organizations and individuals trying to figure this out, but someone needs to bring all this talent and knowledge to the same table. How do we work together to align our resources?"".

For Lawrence, some of the issues faced by the state regarding workforce shortages relate to society's perceptions of some industries.

""You have some kids going to four-year schools who really don't want to be there,"" he said.

""You can make a great living in the trades but a lot of kids don't realize that or misunderstand what a career in a particular field is like.""

He said apprenticeships provide younger people or those looking for a career change with a chance ""To try their hand at something"" before committing to it in the long-term.

""Most degree holders are not working with the degree they paid for, and that's the reason why I love career and technical education in high schools, too"" he said.

""Those programs give you a clue. The kids develop an understanding if they have a passion for something. They can get a similar experience there that they'll have in the field. They won't get that anywhere else.""

Arvelo agrees and said that is why GBCC and other post-secondary institutions continue to build apprenticeship and internship programs.

""Companies can bring in students and mentor them,"" he said.

""Students can make an informed decision and companies can get a first view of someone.""

According to Arvelo, the key to solving New Hampshire's current and future workforce shortage issues will continue to rely on meaningful collaborations between industry and all levels of education in the state.

""It's all about communication and getting people to come together,"" he said.

""I think we can retain more of these high school graduates in the state. They just need to know the jobs are here and there are good paying jobs where they can raise a family and pay a mortgage."""
1312,Body Shop Business,12/30/2017 9:40 AM,"Service King Collision Repair Centers has announced that its fast-growing Apprentice Development Program has officially received certification from the U.S. Department of Labor.

Officials from the Department of Labor, Texas State Representatives and Service King teammates held an official signing ceremony commemorating the milestone on Dec. 21 at Service King's National Support Center in Richardson, Texas.

""This is certainly a proud moment for the Service King family as we continue investing in the development and training of the next generation of skilled automotive technicians,"" said Chris Abraham, Service King CEO. ""The Apprentice Development Program has long been a vision of our company, and we couldn't be more proud to see its growth across the country. It's our mission to equip aspiring technicians with a firm foundation of quality training, hands-on experience and ultimately a long, rewarding career as a Service King teammate.""

The company's certification comes on the heels of a White House Executive Order signed in June promoting the growth of apprenticeship programs across the U.S. Furthermore, the Service King program was instituted to proactively combat a reported 13-percent decline in the population of automotive repair and maintenance workers between 2002-2014 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""I am so happy to have Service King operate in North Texas,"" said State Representative Angie Chen Button.

""Creating a skilled workforce is vital to our state's economy and providing opportunities for job seekers.""

As a certified apprenticeship program, Service King's Apprentice Development Program positions itself to become eligible to receive federal workforce and education funds to reinvest into the growth of the program.

According to the Department of Labor, certified apprenticeships help businesses develop highly skilled employees, increase productivity, reduce turnover and lower the cost of recruitment.

Apprenticeships provide customized training, safer workplaces as well as a stable and reliable pipeline of qualified talent.

The Service King Apprentice Development Program provides incoming technicians a hands-on training program featuring personalized instruction from an apprentice supervisor solely dedicated to the program.

The program features an immersive and proprietary curriculum that promotes a focused learning environment.

To achieve this, each class is capped at four apprentices per instructor.

To ensure a real-world environment, all apprenticeships are hosted inside Service King Collision Repair Centers across the country.

And although the age-old system is still known to be effective, albeit of a less servitude nature than the days of the master and his indentured ? it begs modernization.  The need for modernization of the apprenticeship system is heightened by American industry?s need to address a national talent gap crisis that threatens the country?s competitive edge. And, it is an epidemic that is felt significantly by the manufacturing industry.

According to The Skills Gap in US Manufacturing: 2015 and beyond, a study conducted by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute, the U.S. manufacturing industry is estimated to experience a shortage of two million workers over the 2015?2025 period. Major contributing factors include: the access to skilled-labor, the ability to find the knowledge workers required for advanced manufacturing, and the general public?s attraction to the industry as a career choice ? for both themselves, and their children.  For countries that have embraced apprenticeship modernization, apprenticeship programs have managed to spur career interest in the next generation workforce, sustain knowledge of existing employees, and revitalize the path for ongoing economic value."
1317,Ivy Love,12/5/2017  12:00 PM,"In many areas of rural America, small towns are growing smaller, tiny school districts are merging, and stores and cafes are closing up shop. Meanwhile, lifelong residents watch as young people move away for work or school, and those who remain face precarious economic circumstances. With depopulation comes a host of community challenges: a shrinking number of schools, strained access to preventive and acute healthcare, and increasingly outdated transportation and telecommunication infrastructure.  Downward economic momentum can be hard to stop in distressed rural communities, and meeting these challenges will require innovative solutions that increase economic and educational opportunities, while bolstering community health and sustainability. However, innovative solutions aren?t necessarily new ones. There is a way to cultivate and retain local talent to meet local needs: growing apprenticeships in rural areas. Apprenticeships have been connecting jobseekers to local employers through mentorship and on the job learning in the US for over 75 years.

Apprenticeship is a work-based training model that prepares apprentices for a career in a specific occupation, through class-based and on-the-job learning. In addition to earning a paycheck from day one, apprentices benefit from the expertise and guidance of a designated mentor in their field, who monitors and supports their progress. Some apprenticeship programs include a credential-bearing higher education component, allowing a graduate of a registered apprenticeship program to complete their training with both an industry-recognized certificate and a college degree. And while some begin their apprenticeships right out of high school, the average apprentice in a registered program in the US is 28. Apprenticeship can work for a variety of folks in a variety of circumstances, and it?s time for us to scale up economic opportunity in rural communities by using apprenticeships in innovative ways."
1318,"Mary Alice McCarthy, Iris Palmer & Michael Prebil",12/5/2017 12:00 AM,"In 2014, President Obama issued a national call to double the number of American apprentices within five years. Recently, the Trump administration has also prioritized apprenticeship expansion as a key priority. In a time of intense partisan polarization, apprenticeship has managed to maintain broad appeal. According to a recent New America survey, 88 percent of Americans view apprenticeship favorably. 83 percent feel it should be better funded.

Apprenticeship's appeal isn't hard to understand. It equips individuals with valuable knowledge, skills, and work experience, without saddling them with the tremendous debt many Americans now face in the market for conventional higher education. But this hasn't made it any easier to expand: since the 2014 challenge, the number of current American apprentices has only risen by 100,000, to a total of just over 500,000 nationally ? a tiny population compared to the 17 million students currently enrolled in college. Some of the fastest growing sectors of the American economy, such as IT and healthcare, have only a few thousand apprentices each."
1320,Riia O'Donnell,12/5/2017 2:00 PM,"The number of U.S. apprenticeship occupations could increase three-fold, according to research by Harvard Business School?s Project on Managing the Future of Work and labor market analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies ? potentially expanding the number of actual apprentices by ""eightfold.""  Researchers found that currently only 27 occupations in the U.S. utilize apprenticeship models, accounting for over 400,000 enrollees. Considering there are over 20 million available jobs in the country, that number could increase significantly. The group examined over 23 million job postings to find occupations that could work within a currently used apprenticeship model.  ""Room to Grow: Identifying New Frontiers for Apprenticeships"" considered jobs that met three requirements: a set of specialized skills but no heavy licensing, a living wage and a generally stable workforce. Their findings point to jobs that don?t require a college degree as well as those that request a degree when the work doesn't support its need. They found over 3 million jobs that could be filled by apprentices, many of those in hard-to-fill categories. 

Recognizing the pressing need for skills-based hiring, more employers are moving away from the degree requirements of the past.  The Trump Administration is on board, but from a largely business-driven perspective. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta held the first meeting of the DOL Apprenticeship Task Force, remarking that current U.S. apprenticeship programs ""don?t work."" According to Acosta, businesses should be in charge of apprenticeship creation and oversight, rather than the government.  At the Third Annual Transatlantic Apprenticeship Exchange Forum at the Urban Institute, the discussion revolved around creation of 5 million high-quality apprenticeship programs, as Trump famously promised to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. For apprenticeships to scale, employers and the government need to figure out who is paying, what will be taught and how they will be organized."

The nursing program was one of multiple apprenticeship programs to receive funding from the Connecticut Department of Labor, which worked with the U.S. Department of Labor to secure a total of $5 million in grant money for different programs in the state. According to Nancy Steffens, communications director for the Connecticut Department of Labor, Yale New Haven Hospital will receive $3,500 for each nurse in the program through the labor department?s American Apprenticeship Initiative Grant.

Judith Hahn ? who oversees the hospital?s apprenticeship program, which became the first of its kind in Connecticut when it was established in 2005 ?  described the program as providing an ?earn-while-they-learn? type of training. During their one-year apprenticeship, new nursing school graduates receive mentorship, attend computer-based training and monthly lectures, and learn strategies for stress management.  ?The responsibility of the hospital is great in making sure that they?re comfortable and that they?re confident and that they have safe experiences for them and their patients, and that?s really costly to do right,?

1323,Jordan Scott,12/6/2017  3:00 PM,"Apprenticeships work for the glazing industry and other specialty trades. Researches from the Harvard Business School and Burning Glass Technologies identified what makes these programs work, and how they can be implemented across other sectors. Room to Grow: Identifying New Frontiers for Apprenticeships, a study conducted by both groups, suggests that the U.S. can expand apprenticeships from the 27 industries that currently offer apprenticeship programs, including glazing, to a total of 74 industries.

The report examined 23 million job postings to identify occupations with characteristics similar to existing apprenticeships. Requiring a narrow set of specialized skills without heavy licensing, having largely stable workforces and consistently paying a living wage are the three necessary characteristics for a successful apprenticeship program, according to the study.  There were 21 occupations identified that fall under the category of expander roles, or occupations that don?t require a bachelor?s degree, such as solar photovoltaic installers and computer-controlled machine tool operators."
1324,Odie Donald II,12/6/2017 10:47 AM,"Over the last decades, many American inner cities have seen an economic resurgence. Buoyed by millennials and people's desire to shorten their daily work commute, neighborhoods and communities that were all but pronounced dead two decades ago now find themselves flush with new businesses and residents.  This is no more evident than here in the District of Columbia, where the economic recovery of the city has been nothing short of breathtaking. However, as many have noted, this growth has not been equally beneficial to all residents.

While policymakers and advocates search for answers and solutions to this problem, there is one time-tested and proven tool that should be a key part of any workforce development strategy-apprenticeships.  Introduced in the 14th century, apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction, teaching workers the practical and theoretical aspects of highly-skilled occupations. Apprenticeship programs can be sponsored by employers, labor groups, or employer associations."

The talent gap we face in Florida is not a new problem nor is it unique to our state. According to the Florida Chamber, while more than 400,000 are looking for jobs, we still have 232,000 jobs looking for people. Florida?s employers and workforce development, economic development and education entities are collaborating to bridge that gap with a new focus on apprenticeships.

The National Office of Apprenticeship, within the U.S. Department of Labor, has set a goal of doubling and diversifying the number of apprenticeships by 2019. Florida is among 36 states and Guam recently selected to help make that big goal a reality through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative. The responsibility tied to these grants is clear: build partnerships across key industries and organizations to create a strong talent pipeline for businesses in vital industries like advanced manufacturing and information technology.  Recently I had the opportunity to talk with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta about the importance of expanding apprenticeship opportunities during his visit with Gov. Rick Scott in Tallahassee. Florida is the third largest state in the nation, with low unemployment ? just 3.8 percent in September ? and record job growth.

1329,Kathy Gurchiek Dec 7,12/7/2017 1:34 AM,"What jobs lend themselves best to the apprenticeship model? How about medical equipment preparers and repairers, nuclear medicine technologists, chemical technicians and insurance sales agents?

These jobs are not typically associated with apprenticeships, but they are among occupations whose deep but narrow skill sets make them suitable for an ""Earn while you learn"" training mode, according to a new study.

""There is significant, unrealized potential in the apprenticeship field across many occupations in the U.S. economy,"" according to Room to Grow: Identifying New Frontiers for Apprenticeships, a report released Nov. 29.

Joseph B. Fuller, co-director of the ""Managing the Future of Work Project,"" a multiyear initiative at Harvard Business School, and Matthew Sigelman, CEO of analytics software company Burning Glass in Boston, conducted the study.

They examined skills that were required in postings for more than 23 million jobs in 2016 and identified underlying skills that could be developed through apprenticeships.

Based on this skills analysis, there is significant opportunity to expand apprenticeships in the U.S., the research found.

Apprenticeships could help fill positions that employers find difficult to staff.

The model offers prospective employees ""a more viable alternative to trade and technical schools"" because in a technical school system students miss out on work experience while they attend school, or they work but can only attend school part-time, they said in their report.

Licensure represents a separate credential ""That may reduce the value of the apprenticeship as proof of a worker's qualifications, while adding an additional layer of government approval onto the process.""The occupation has a relatively narrow cluster of clearly defined, consistent skills.

The scope of training and teaching is manageable, and the skills can be obtained through specialized training, such as apprenticeships.

The occupation requires skills that students can obtain by earning a high school diploma or associate's degree.

Apprenticeships often are intended as an alternative path to a four-year college degree, the report noted, and jobs for which most employers require an advanced degree likely involve a range of skills ill-suited to apprenticeship training.

The occupation tends to have higher-than-average employment tenure and lower-than-average turnover.

This make the investment in an apprenticeship more attractive to employers, the report noted.

The occupation pays a living wage of $15 or more per hour.

The investment of time and effort required for an apprenticeship does not make sense when applied to low-paying jobs, the report noted.

Based on the above criteria, Fuller and Sigelman identified 47 career fields where apprenticeships could be offered: 21 occupations were in what they called the ""Expander"" group whose skills can be gained at a sub-baccalaureate level, jobs such as customer service representatives, solar photovoltaic installers and medical secretaries and transcriptionists.

26 occupations were what they called ""Boosters."" Unlike ""Expanders,"" this group commonly requires a bachelor's degree and includes jobs such as computer user support specialists, database administrators, graphic designers, HR specialists, insurance underwriters and legal secretaries.

""Each of the jobs in these two groups requires a skillset that is narrow and deep,"" with expertise needed in two or three areas, Fuller said.

Apprenticeships have started springing up in nontrade union jobs.

Global hospitality company Hilton Worldwide pledged in 2016 to set up the first U.S. apprenticeship system in tourism and to launch 370 apprenticeship positions over the next five years in areas such as culinary arts and housekeeping.

Samsung Tech Institutes provide technical training in areas such as software development and computer programming and in 2014 launched a two-year web designer training program in France.

The Hartford, the Connecticut-based property and casualty insurance firm, plans to bring 200 apprentices onboard by 2020.

The report suggests that an apprenticeship approach is a way for organizations struggling with skills gaps to ensure workers are trained to the employers' specifications.

This is done by partnering with local educators to create a curriculum and on-the-job training program that aligns with employers' needs.

""You need to be able to tie underlying competencies someone needs to perform those two or three tasks ,"" define a structured program that allows a trainee to work alongside an experienced employee and augment that training with classroom-type work, such as at a community college, Fuller said.

""It's very important that a significant component of the work be in the place of business, not in the community college,"" he told SHRM Online.

Work-based learning is a way for the employer to get to know the job candidates during training and for the apprentice to get to know the employer, he pointed out.

""By having the opportunity for the company to interact with that person and have them exposed to your team, your colleagues it allows to make an informed hiring decision,"" Fuller said.

""That's really important because a tremendous percentage of failed hires are failing because of soft-skill deficiency,"" such as a lack of punctuality, an inability to receive criticism or an inability to work with others.

He advised starting a pilot apprenticeship program, with HR working with stakeholders who can advise on the types of skills necessary for the apprentice to develop.

An employer can use that knowledge to develop a program with an outside resource, such as a community college or vendor.

The timeframe for an apprenticeship can vary from six to 12 months, or longer if the program is blended with academic training that is spread over several semesters, Fuller said.

Apprentices usually get an hourly wage but not many benefits, he said.

The U.S. has a Registered Apprenticeship system that he said many employers find cumbersome, but ""No law says you have to have a registered program.""

Initially, productivity will suffer at the beginning of an apprenticeship program because the apprentice will not perform as quickly as an experienced employee and the work of the employee who helps train the apprentice will be slowed.

Creating a program gives the employer more control over the talent pipeline.

It's important that employers remember that apprenticeships are a longer-term investment, Fuller said.

""It's hard to get skilled workers and, in many instances, the traditional sources of talent are not always generating candidates who have the combination of hard skills and soft skills to be attractive hires,"" he said.

The question for employers is ""Am I going to continue to rely on my traditional strategies for identifying qualified candidates, or am I going to broaden my toolkit?""."
1330,Business Wire,12/7/2017 2:56 PM,"CHICAGO-()-Today, on the one-year anniversary the Future Energy Jobs Act, ComEd announced four organizations have been selected to develop and conduct solar pipeline training programs made possible through grants funded by FEJA. Elevate Energy, Illinois Central College, OAI, Inc., and the Safer Foundation, will receive a total of $3 million as a part of the first wave of FEJA funding to train individuals to work in the solar industry.

Passed by the Illinois General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Rauner one year ago today, FEJA allocates a total of $30 million to develop and implement a number of major energy job training programs.

The $30 million in funding will be allocated in three $10 million increments paid in 2017, 2021 and 2025, and used to support job training programs over the next 12 years.

As FEJA outlines, the solar pipeline training effort will focus on individuals who are from economically disadvantaged and environmental justice communities, alumni of the Illinois foster care system and Returning Citizens.

The multicultural training grants totaling $4 million were awarded in November to the Chicago Urban League, Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, National Latino Education Institute, ASPIRA, Inc. of Illinois, Chatham Business Association Small Business Development, Inc. and Austin Peoples Action Center and will target individuals from diverse and/or underserved backgrounds.

The third program, a craft apprenticeship training program being offered through the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers, received a $3 million grant last month.

""ComEd is committed to helping grow renewable energy in Illinois and equally dedicated to developing the workforce of the future who will help integrate more clean energy like solar, into the Illinois energy grid,"" said Anne Pramaggiore, ComEd President and CEO. ""The training programs that will be created by the organizations announced today will ensure that the next generation of energy workers is prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities created by a new clean energy economy. We are excited to see this part of the FEJA take flight and look forward to working with these partners to ensure success of these job training programs.""

ComEd engaged the Chicago Community Trust, an Illinois foundation that works to transform lives and communities, to develop and administer a rigorous RFP process to evaluate proposed solar pipeline training grantees and their programs.

CCT, with the help of a Technical Review Committee and Policy Review Committee made up of workforce development, energy markets, community development and organizational capacity experts evaluated all proposals.

Grantees selected to receive funding were determined based on the following criteria: geographic reach, experience delivering workforce training programs and alignment with the goals of the FEJA legislation, including successful recruitment, training, and placement of trainees who are or were foster children and Returning Citizens.

As Peggy Davis, Chief Officer Programs and Strategic Integration at The Chicago Community Trust, remarked, ""Our partnership with ComEd gives us the chance to support the workforce development goals of FEJA while helping Illinois pivot to a green economy. We are confident that the organizations we selected to receive financial support align well with our shared goal of building sustainable communities and an inclusive economy, especially among those who have experienced hardship."" Funding for all three workforce training initiatives outlined by the FEJA - Multicultural Training efforts, a Craft Apprenticeship program, and now, Solar Pipeline training - will be disbursed before the end of this year.

The Future Energy Jobs Act was passed last December with broad bipartisan support from more than 200 businesses, labor, environmental, faith-based and other groups and became effective in June.

The historic legislation will help create thousands of clean energy jobs, provides funding for job training and also will help jumpstart renewables in Illinois - setting the stage to grow enough solar and wind energy to power one million homes.

In addition it will significantly expands energy efficiency programs, creating more than $4 billion in consumer savings and reducing the amount of CO2 in the air equivalent to removing 18 million cars from the road. Further, the FEJA contains significant programs for low-income communities and extends ComEd's customer assistance programs through 2021.

Commonwealth Edison Company is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation, the nation's leading competitive energy provider, with approximately 10 million customers.

ComEd provides service to approximately 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state's population.

The Chicago Community Trust, our region's community foundation, partners with donors to leverage their philanthropy in ways that transform lives and communities.

The Trust connects the generosity of donors with community needs by making grants to nonprofit organizations working to improve metropolitan Chicago.

Since our founding in 1915, the Trust has awarded approximately $2 billion in grant funding to more than 11,000 local nonprofit organizations - including more than $236 million in 2016."
1334,Catherine Gewertz,12/8/2017 12:43 PM,"It's a time-worn idea: a young person becomes an apprentice, probably in traditional trades like construction, and then goes out into the working to earn good middle-class wages without a college degree.  But why should apprenticeships exclude college? And how can they be expanded in fields like cybersecurity and healthcare, where they could play a key role in career preparation? What changes could we make that would allow more young people to get the benefits of both apprenticeship and college?

Those are the questions at the heart of a paper released this week by the think tank New America.  Apprenticeship is a hot topic now, part of President Donald Trump's vision for all high school students, and increasingly popular among policymakers as a way to build job skills and nourish the labor market without the time and debt of a bachelor's degree.  In the rush to elevate apprenticeships, some fear that the value of college could be overlooked."

1342,Philip Gruber,2/10/2017 4:41 PM,"STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - Experienced dairy farmers don't just appear out of thin air.

A national apprenticeship program aims to foster that development by providing a formal route into the dairy industry.

""It's very difficult to create a full-blown farmer, and that's what we're looking for,"" said Joe Tomandl, a Wisconsin dairy farmer and executive director of the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship program.

Tomandl spoke at the Farming for the Future Conference on Feb. 3 at The Penn Stater.

The two-year apprenticeship program requires participants to complete 4,000 hours of training.

Apprentices spend most of those hours getting their hands dirty - ""Everything from ear tagging to feed budgeting,"" Tomandl said - while the rest of the time is spent on classroom training.

The apprentices learn from a master grazier, a farmer who has at least five years of experience with managed grazing or certified organic dairying.

On-the-ground experience is irreplaceable in creating a farmer, and there's no better teacher than someone who is already doing the job, Tomandl said.

The masters must be committed to training an apprentice, not looking for a way to hire a milker or tractor driver.

Being a master farmer requires a commitment, but ""It really isn't a ton of extra time,"" Tomandl said.

In return, the farmer gets a well-trained employee who can run the farm competently when the farmer takes a vacation or wants to retire from the business, he said.

Tomandl and other Wisconsin farmers started developing the apprenticeship program around 2009 with help from their state's Department of Workforce Development.

The farmers spent 10 months developing a curriculum trying to emulate the success of established apprenticeships for plumbers, electricians and other tradesmen.

The apprenticeship is registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and run by the industry nonprofit Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship, which helps the program take advantage of grants and lends credibility to the program.

""Now this thing can be taken and used by any farmer anywhere,"" Tomandl said.

The balance of the off-farm training can include facilitated pasture walks, Extension programs and professional development workshops.

These events help loop the apprentice into the local dairy industry, Tomandl said.

The program administrators are trying to see if exceptions to the education requirements can be made for Plain farmers, who may stop formal schooling before high school, Tomandl said.

Veterans can receive GI Bill benefits during the apprenticeship period because the program is federally registered and taught by an accredited institution.

Seeking structured training, some farm families have even brought their children through the program.

It is easier to talk about a subject because the program, not Dad, says you have to do it, Tomandl said.

For Tomandl, a former ag teacher, one goal of the apprenticeship program is to simplify the path he and his wife took to buy their first farm.

He worked on a neighbor's farm in the 1980s, but ""I couldn't afford that farm when it came down to it,"" he said.

Tomandl instead bought an 80-acre farm in 1998 and focused on grazing.

When he had added enough cows, he bought another farm and started grazing there too.

He figures he could have kept scaling up as a confinement operation on his home farm, ending his career with 1,500 cows and a $10 million operation that would be hard to sell if his children did not want to take over.

Several smaller farms would be easier to sell and better suited to a grazing system, he said.

Tomandl has now taken two apprentices through the program on his farm.

Audrey Gay Rodgers, who runs Hameau Farm in Belleville, said farm transfer and the ability to learn from the program herself motivated her to become a master grazier.

Rodgers already operates a teaching farm with a summer program for girls 8-14.

Rodgers is interviewing candidates and may have an apprentice or two starting in early summer.

Nationwide, about 100 master farmers and 160 candidates have been approved.

Thirty-five master-apprentice pairs are active, Tomandl said.

Participants so far are clustered in the Midwest and Northeast - places where the program has built ties with universities, he said.

Aaron de Long, an education coordinator for the apprentice program and a program manager for the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture, oversees the training of three apprentices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

In most apprenticeship programs, the master tradesman will just take the name on the top of the list of available candidates.

Dairy farming is a more personal situation, with long hours spent around the farmer's home, so master graziers often do some interviewing and bring the candidate to the farm before taking the person on as an apprentice.

""We're not going to get in the middle of hiring,"" Tomandl said.

""This could be a template for livestock, for commodity organic grains, for produce,"" Tomandl said.

1343,OSEC,2/12/2018  12:00 PM,"U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta today commented on President Donald J. Trump?s Fiscal Year 2019 budget request for the U.S. Department of Labor. Through targeted investments and common sense reforms, the Department?s budget request supports the President?s continued efforts to create good, safe jobs for the American people.  ?The President?s budget provides a fiscally responsible framework to advance the Department of Labor?s mission of ensuring all Americans have access to family-sustaining jobs,? said Secretary Acosta. ?From addressing the skills gap through apprenticeships to prioritizing workplace safety, this budget reflects a strong commitment to the American workforce. It also includes important reforms to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used to maximum effect.?

The FY 2019 request for the Department of Labor is $10.9 billion in discretionary budget authority, paired with mandatory investments and reforms.  Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Labor Budget Request Highlights:

    Equips Americans with the skills they need to fill open, high-paying jobs by increasing investment to $200 million in apprenticeships, a proven earn-while-you-learn strategy. Apprenticeships match job creators with job seekers, furthering the goal of a skilled American workforce.
    Places a priority on helping protect American workers through robust enforcement of worker safety laws and compliance assistance outreach.  The budget includes:
        $549 million for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to help ensure workers are safe on the job, providing $135 million for federal and state compliance assistance activities to enhance employer outreach and training.
        $230 million for the Wage and Hour Division to protect wages and working conditions in U.S. workplaces, including a funding increase of $4 million to educate employers on how to comply with the law.
        $376 million for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, reflecting a strong commitment to enforcement, compliance assistance, training, and innovative technologies to protect the safety and health of the nation?s miners.
        $190 million for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, providing a $2 million increase to provide interpretive guidance, enforcement, oversight activities, and compliance assistance.
        $47 million for the Office of Labor-Management Standards to administer safeguards for labor union democracy and financial integrity, including a funding increase of $3 million to re-establish the International Compliance Audit Program.
    Protects the American workforce by requesting Congressional authorization to cover the operating costs for foreign labor certification programs through fees paid by employers who use these programs. This will ensure that only employers who use the program pay for it instead of funding it from tax dollars, and the program will have a more reliable, workload-based source of funding that ultimately eliminates the need for appropriations.
    Provides for paid family leave for new parents.  The Budget invests in a better future for Americans with a proposal to provide six weeks of paid family leave to new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents, so all families can afford to take time to recover from childbirth and bond with a new child. 
    Reforms the Federal Employees? Compensation Act program by modernizing program administration, simplifying benefit rates, and introducing controls to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.
    Creates a more accountable and efficient Department by centralizing administrative activities such as procurement, human resources, financial management, and security within the Department to improve oversight, eliminate duplication, and save money. The Budget also provides the Department with flexibilities to better allocate resources to fund IT modernization."

This distinct honor allows Edison State to leverage funds through the State of Ohio and build upon the vast amount of partnering opportunities with regional industry.  The new apprenticeship program at Edison State is part of the U.S. Department of Labor?s Registered Apprenticeship College Consortium project and most recently supported by a $65,000 grant from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

Key objectives of the grant include: 1) to significantly increase the number and locations of registered apprenticeship embedded work experiences, 2) employ best practices in student and company registered apprenticeship support, and 3) to provide a simplified college-based point of entry process for employers to engage in registered apprenticeship programs.  With these key objectives in mind, Edison State has hired Brandi Olberding as a full-time Director of Apprenticeship and Work-Based Learning following an extensive search."

This three-year Registered Apprenticeship specializes in the occupations of Water Treatment Plant and Wastewater Treatment Operators. Apprentices will receive 2,000 on-the-job and 144 classroom training hours per year and will earn a nationally recognized journeyman certificate upon completion of the program.

Derrick Ramsey, Labor Cabinet Secretary, said that his hope is more cities throughout the Commonwealth will emulate the unique partnership in order to tackle today?s important workforce challenges. Prestonsburg Utilities Commission Superintendent and CEO Turner Campbell said the current workforce of certified operators is an aging one will likely face critical shortages in the future, but this program will shorten certification times and replace retiring operators quickly.

Both the company and its labor union, the United Steelworkers, agreed at that time that the need did not justify the work required to oversee the official program, said Dave Rodgers, senior human resource manager.  Now, a tightening labor market and a recent push by state and federal agencies has prodded All-Clad to restart it.

The company has registered its millwright and electrician apprenticeship programs for its team of maintenance workers. And it is eyeing a third program, an industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeship that would be available to its production workers ? the bulk of its employees.  ?The pool of skilled candidates is just not there,? said Mr. Rodgers, who oversees a plant workforce of about 200 people.  ?It became very apparent that folks liked having the certificate in their hands,? he added. ?It?s a piece of paper that, should something happen to their employment here and they go elsewhere, they could say, ?Hey, I?m qualified to do this job.??

Apprenticeships ? an arrangement by which an employer pays workers a salary as they take training courses alongside working shifts ? has become a buzzword for workforce officials hoping to connect job-seekers with employers amid a sea change in skills.  While apprenticeships are common practice in the building trades and at larger companies, officials have seen growing potential for the practice in smaller operations such as All-Clad."
1366,Casey Schreiner,2/20/2017  10:00 AM,"Montana?s economy and workforce have remained strong over the last two years thanks to highly skilled employees, partnerships with the private and public sectors, and expanded training opportunities in our two-year colleges. Our state has a healthy employment rate that continues to be bolstered by diverse industries. It is a good time to be a member of the labor force under the Big Sky.  But as our state?s workforce continues to age and retire, the legislature needs to seriously consider opportunities that will strengthen apprenticeship programs and train the next generation of Montanans. The biggest roadblock to businesses growth is often a shortage of skilled, trained workers. The problem will only get worse for Montana, unless we act now.

1368,Vic Bradshaw Daily News-record,2/20/2017 12:53 AM,"HARRISONBURG - Virginia's free online job board has been revamped to make it more likely that job seekers will find employment and businesses will acquire the help they need.

Updates to the Virginia Workforce Connection, accessible at www.

Gov, include new features to help potential employees find and apply for jobs in their communities and tools to help them identify careers aligned with their interests and skills, according to a news release from Gov. Terry McAuliffe's office.

""Virginia's diverse and talented workforce is one of the Commonwealth's greatest assets,"" Secretary of Commerce and Trade Todd Haymore said in the release.

""Our competitiveness relies, in part, on our ability to connect job-ready candidates to career opportunities.""

The website now allows job seekers to search for positions using a ZIP-code radius search.

A Friday morning search of available jobs within 10 miles of the 22801 ZIP code returned 535 public- and private-sector jobs listings in Harrisonburg, Bridgewater, Dayton, Mount Crawford, McGaheysville, Hinton and Weyers Cave.

George Anas, Rockingham County's economic development director, said he thinks the changes can help close the disconnect that sometimes occurs between job seekers and employers needing help.

""I don't know that it will solve the problem, but it's moving a step in the right direction,"" he said.

""There are a lot of resources out there for both employees and employers, and in too many instances there are too many places to find information and it's too difficult to find a place where they're aggregated.""

""I think the idea that we're able to now bring this under one umbrella can go a long way to help us solve some of the issues surrounding unemployment.""

The ZIP-code search function isn't the only addition to the Virginia Workforce Connection.

For job seekers, the site has tools to help them find the career for which they're best suited and create a ""Virtual Recruiter"" that alerts them to job postings aligned with their profile.

It also can provide registered users information on relevant workforce training opportunities, including an online learning platform.

Anas said the fact that more than 500 jobs are open within 10 miles of Harrisonburg at a time when the metropolitan area has a 3.6 percent unemployment rate illustrates the need for high school students and job seekers to be sure their skills align with the types of jobs available locally.

""This should enhance the idea that for some people, instead of going to a four-year school, you go to Blue Ridge Community College or Massanutten Technical School, get a credential, and start work with one of our local employers, making a lot of money,"" he said.

""And if you stay long enough, they're going to pay for you to go to school and get your degree and make more money on top of it.""

For Virginia businesses, the website now ""Offers a fully customizable recruiting experience and the ability to build robust job postings and customer-tailored job applications,"" according to the release.

Apprenticeships, internships and on-the-job training opportunities can be promoted via the site, too.

The Virginia Workforce Connection contains more than 150,000 active job listings and more than 70,000 active candidate resumes.

Site Selection magazine recently ranked Virginia second in the Atlantic region for it's workforce development efforts, and McAuliffe said the Virginia Workforce Connection changes exemplify those activities.

""This is one way,"" he said in the release, ""We're using technology to help close the skills gap in the Commonwealth and furthering our efforts to build a new Virginia economy."""

1380,Kara Murphy,2/21/2017 6:09 AM,"At just 23, Mike Field has a life many of his high school classmates who went on to college can't even dream of yet.

""I know college gives you 'the hardware' - the diploma - but from what I've seen, experience counts too, and I'm learning every day,"" he said.

""At the same time, I'm earning a paycheck.""

Field chose to go to work at Industrial Sales and Manufacturing after high school instead of attending college.

Officials from the company, located at 2609 W. 12th St., chose him to continue on in a formal apprentice role last year.

As an apprentice, Field spends time in each department of the manufacturing sections of the company, becoming skilled at each area before moving on to the next, said Lori Dever, ISM's workforce development manager.

By the time the apprenticeship is complete, Field will have received a nationally recognized certificate of apprenticeship, coupled with more than a dozen National Institute for Metalworking Skills credentials.

ISM is just one of the Erie County companies participating in the Erie Regional Manufacturer Partnership, which was formed in 2014 by a group of 20 local manufacturers to develop and implement a plan to identify, qualify and recruit workers.

The organization now has 43 members, said Diane Karlin, ERMP's project manager.

The need for skilled workers in manufacturing has brought together manufacturing competitors for a common goal, she said.

""We need skilled workers, we need to develop a credentialed workforce. They need to be trained, and there's no better place to train them than inside our own plants right here,"" she said.

""Establishing apprenticeship programs starts to put in that pipeline of young workers who gain the skills and competencies they need to step in and replace retiring workers, while also developing the foundation for a great manufacturing career.""

Apprenticeships are an important part of the equation when considering how to grow the workforce, said Jim Rutkowski Jr., the general manager of ISM. His company has a goal of adding an apprentice every year.

""An apprenticeship is a valuable tool in that process because it's a learn-while-you-earn model,"" he said.

""And it combines on-the-job training with job-related instruction tied to the attainment of national skills standards.""

As part of the efforts to ramp up the number of local apprenticeships, ERMP helped the Greater Oh-Penn Mfg. Apprenticeship Network secure a 5-year $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor in 2016.

In its first year, Oh-Penn, whose footprint spans 14 counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania, exceeded its goal of placing 25 apprentices.

Fourteen of those placements are at manufacturing plants in Erie County at companies including small machine shops and larger businesses, Karlin said.

Companies like ISM that hire an apprentice receive a sliding reimbursement for training costs, starting at $6,000.

That reimbursement is just a drop in the bucket in terms of expected return on investment, Rutkowski said.

""I'm expecting to lose 10 percent of my workforce every year for the next 10 years to retirement,"" Rutkowski said.

""So we're working hard to get young people into manufacturing and to do that, we have to invest in them and they have to invest in us. If we're going to be successful in the future, we need those young people here.""

ISM and other local companies introduce students to the idea of a career in manufacturing - and the benefits of apprenticeships - early by taking part in recruitment efforts like inviting high school classes in for tours of the plant and participating in a summer manufacturing camp.

""Part of that goal is to get our young people to look at manufacturing in a different way,"" said Dever.

""People in the past have viewed manufacturing as dark and dingy, but manufacturing today is high-tech. It's bright and shiny. We've got the latest, most up-to-date equipment. You have to, to remain competitive in the global marketplace. But that's also the kind of thing that changes young people's mindsets, and gets them interested in a manufacturing career. The chance at an apprenticeship - where you learn while you earn and really get a jump start on your career - is another recruitment tool."""

Aware of such a statistic, a team of educators at NPHS have been collaborating to present students with an opportunity to better prepare and inform them for the workforce and college after graduating from high school. Listed as an official course in the program of studies, NPHS now offers students the chance to enroll in the Career Apprenticeship Program for the summer of 2017, which will count as a half of a credit upon completion.

Mr. Dominic Calamia, a special education and math teacher and the coordinator of the Career Apprenticeship Program at NPHS, explained that any junior transitioning to senior year with enough credits to be considered a senior is eligible to participate.  ?The program is basically [for] students who want a better look at a certain career. Maybe they can?t get that look in the classroom, through career study, or their class schedule is restricting them, so they can do it over the summer.

1393,Matt Krentz And Claire Tracey,2/24/2017 10:39 AM,"What can companies do to ensure their senior-level women feel engaged throughout the employee lifecycle and, in turn, are freer to cultivate a work environment that leads to better business results?

Employee engagement is a critical indicator of a company's success, as engaged employees feel a bond with their company, are proud to work there and take steps to improve the company's prospects.

The Boston Consulting Group's recent report - The Rewards of an Engaged Female Workforce - examines how engagement levels change over time between men and women, and how existing trends impact the most seasoned employees.

The study was designed to examine engagement based on key areas including mentorship, work-life balance and compensation and promotion opportunities.

The results reveal that companies that get engagement right - those with the highest engagement scores overall - do not have any disparity between genders.

However in companies that do not - companies with slightly above average, average and low engagement scores overall - there is a prominent gender gap.

We found that this gender gap increases with seniority, disproportionately affecting women in senior managerial positions and above.

This creates two challenges: Not only does engagement correlate with financial performance, but if senior women leave, companies pay an additional penalty around leadership diversity.

There are several factors that contribute to this gap.

Some women report feeling underleveraged in their positions, which suggests that employers are missing an opportunity to utilize the full skillsets of some of their employees - a problem for both the employee and the company.

With regard to mentor and coworker relationships, men are more likely to cite more positive and closer connections as they rise in seniority.

Women have somewhat lower ratings when asked if their managers care about their wellbeing and if there is a sense of support amongst their teams.

A lack of meaningful relationships can lead employees to lessen their commitment to an organization.

With rising seniority, some expect that employees are meant to feel more of a connection to the organization, form closer bonds with colleagues and managers and be supported in their aspirations.

While many men hold this sentiment, women on average experience somewhat less of a sense of mutual appreciation and loyalty as they reach higher ranks.

Having an engaged workforce is a priority for a number of organizations and is top of mind for many who sit within HR, diversity and inclusion, and talent acquisition.

Understand the unique issues women face in your organization.

Every workplace is different; there is no one-size-fits-all approach for getting engagement right.

The focus here should be organization-wide and not focus solely on senior women.

Through listening exercises, companies can learn what the root causes are of disengagement.

Whether it's through surveys or open dialogues between employees and managers, having tangible interactions will make it easier to identify what solutions work best for your organization.

Once you understand the root causes of the engagement gap you can start looking at solutions.

If a primary issue is dissatisfaction with manager relationships, this could point to a need to reshape how performance feedback is given.

In 2010 we found this issue within our own organization.

Employees reported that the feedback they received was too focused on areas that needed improvement and lacked recognition of their strengths.

To address the issue we implemented a new method for feedback that encourages managers to highlight strengths as means to tackle weaknesses.

This change was made as part of the launch of our Apprenticeship in Action program, which specifically aimed to enhance the mentorship experience for women - but satisfaction with the feedback process increased by ten percentage points for both male and female employees.

Allow senior managers to shape job responsibilities.

To guarantee that the strengths of your workforce are fully utilized, companies should consider offering senior managers more flexibility in determining job roles, allowing them to focus on their expertise and passions.

Within reason, performance management systems should have customization options in order to embrace the unique strengths of high level employees.

Part of achieving this solution is promoting employees based on potential, not just performance.

This will help companies cultivate a diverse set of leadership styles, which is more conducive to fostering a creative and successful work environment.

Companies should strive to support their employees across all levels of the organization.

A major part of this involves demonstrating loyalty to team members - including those at the senior level.

Management should actively invest in sponsorship connections for their employees, including ensuring that promising women have mentors, sponsors and peers with whom they can communicate openly and frequently.

This approach takes mentorship beyond performance reviews that simply check the boxes - and demonstrates a genuine investment in employees.

Women want to be engaged in the workplace - they want to bring their best selves to the office and be part of teams that conduct meaningful and valuable work.

This should become easier for women as they reach higher levels of seniority, not harder.

The tools exist for companies to develop a more engaged female workforce.

When they invest in these changes, the results can be beneficial for all."

1408,Staff Report,2/28/2018  11:59 PM,"In years past, St. Paul?s seniors who were academically eligible were given the opportunity to enroll in a free period. The creation of this elective was intended to give burdened seniors a break so that they may catch up on school work and college applications, while also introducing them to the free time that they would be confronted with in the coming four years.  This year, however, free period has been replaced with the Apprenticeship Program after seniors began to request time to leave the campus and intern.  ?What we learned from (free period) is that a handful of seniors each year came and said so I have this free time, can I go off campus and do this,? Principal Trevor Watkins said. ?And we began to think about it, and thought, why not? That?s a good use of that time. They were making very productive use of the time elsewhere, and so it morphed away from the so called ?free period? towards an apprenticeship.?

According to school administration, though the free period was created to take a load off of encumbered seniors, the elective came to be abused by some. Instead of making use of the time to catch up on college essays or study for a physics test, a number of students chose to wander around campus or play hacky sack.  ?We found that the students who used the free period were not necessarily the students who needed the free period,? Watkins said, ?and it just became an opportunity to hang out around the campus and became a pain for a lot of people ? you know, noise outside of classrooms and making a mess in the library. It didn?t work.?"
1415,"Ben Gitis, Chad Miller & Rahee Jung",2/5/2018  1:00 PM,"At the end of 2017, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce voted to advance the PROSPER Act, a bill that would reform and reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965.[2] The legislation aims to support students in completing affordable post-secondary education that better prepares them with the skills needed to succeed in today?s labor force. A key component of the bill is a new competitive grant program that would expand apprenticeships in high-growth industries.

Apprenticeships provide workers with on-the-job education, enabling them to develop essential skills while earning an income. In turn, an apprenticeship can enable a low-skilled, low-wage worker to pursue a career with promising wage growth. Today?s registered apprenticeships, however, are not properly aligned with the industries that demand the most skilled workers. In particular, apprenticeships are heavily concentrated in goods-producing industries, like manufacturing and construction, while the vast majority of job growth is projected to occur in service-providing industries, such as health care and professional and business services. U.S. apprenticeships need to be reoriented to prepare workers for the jobs employers will demand. The PROSPER Act aims to do this by incentivizing participating education providers to prepare workers for in-demand jobs while providing them with the operational flexibility that best fits the local labor market."

PASSAIC - Sen. Cory Booker, other lawmakers, union leaders and business executives on Monday called for jump-starting vocational training and apprenticeships nationally, creating a young and skilled American workforce that can compete internationally.

""We have millions of jobs in this country that are going unfilled because we are not training our workforce for the 21st century,"" Booker said.

""While other nations around the globe are rushing to change their workforce training policies, America is lagging behind.""

The senator spoke at a gathering at Falstrom Co., a metal-products manufacturer founded in 1870, where he was joined by Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, and state Assemblyman Gary Schaer, D-Passaic, to talk about legislative efforts aimed at fostering apprenticeships, which combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction, creating a pathway to jobs for youths or older unemployed workers who need retraining.

In today's technology-driven world, which is becoming more automated, U.S. employers are desperate for workers trained in skills needed for manufacturing, health care and information technology - not potential employees with liberal-arts college degrees, according to the lawmakers.

With skilled workers such as welders available, unemployment - especially for young Americans - would drop, Booker and Pascrell said.

Countries such as Germany, Japan and England are providing this kind of education, helping to create jobs for their citizens, according to Booker.

Germany, which has a large apprenticeship program, has the lowest unemployment rate for youths, 7 percent, Booker said.

In contrast, in the U.S. the youth unemployment rate is about 11.5 percent, Pascrell said.

To an audience of more than 150 people, including several dozen Falstrom workers, Booker described a bill that he is sponsoring with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., which would offer employers tax incentives for hiring apprentices who are registered with the federal Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency.

That legislation is the Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs, or LEAP. Schaer, in turn, said he plans to introduce a bill in the state Legislature that that would establish an apprenticeship incentive grant program, initially funded by $1.5 million from the state, to be matched by federal funds.

Under the measure, employers would be reimbursed between 50 percent to 75 percent of the salaries that they pay to apprentices over a five-year period.

Pascrell discussed the importance that two-year community colleges can play in training youths for jobs in today's economy, lauding Bergen Community College and Passaic County Community College.

Free tuition to such community schools would benefit 9 million students, according to Pascrell.

One of the beneficiaries of trade retraining was in the audience, Falstrom welder Erik Di Stefano of West Milford.

He said that he had been unemployed after working in IT for 15 years when he attended a program at Bergen Community College to be trained in welding, and landed a job at the Passaic manufacturer about a year ago.

Falstrom employs 45 people, according to company President Clifford Lindholm III, who said, ""It's always a challenge to find skilled employees.""

Pascrell also said America's job losses should be blamed on the failure to train workers for the available jobs.

""And it ain't the immigrants that are taking our jobs,"" Pascrell said.

""It's innovation, it's automation that's taken our jobs over the last 40 to 50 years. What could be more important than preparing our young people for the careers of tomorrow?"".

Both Pascrell and Booker said that four years in college should not be an automatic path for youths anymore in today's economy.

Said Booker, ""I believe we have to start challenging what I think is actually a fiction: that in order to be successful everyone has to go to college. We clearly know that there are people making strong in-roads into the middle class - succeeding, establishing their American Dream - who don't go to college but have the necessary skills.""

Charles Wowkanech, president of the AFL-CIO of New Jersey, said his union has been trying to expand its apprenticeship programs in partnership with businesses and government."
1422,File,2/7/2017 12:15 PM,"Job creation, growth, training and protection are among Gov. Tom Wolf's 2017-18 budget priorities.

Wolf presented his proposed $32.3 billion budget before the Pennsylvania General Assembly Tuesday morning.

The budget focused on three main areas - schools that teach, government that works and jobs that pay.

To provide jobs that pay, Wolf wants to increase the minimum wage, foster job creation and growth, implement job and career development, and offer tax credits.

Wolf has proposed increasing Pennsylvania's minimum from $7.25 to $12 per hour.

The budget contends that an increase in the state's minimum wage would support local businesses, create new jobs and boost state revenue by roughly $95 million annually.

""Pennsylvanians who work full time at minimum wage earn $15,080 annually, leaving them below the poverty level for a family of four and often unable to afford basic necessities,"" according to the budget.

""Employees have become more productive, increasing business efficiency and competitiveness, but wages have not kept pace with these productivity gains.""

Manufacturing is the third-largest industry in Pennsylvania employing over 550,000 workers.

Wolf has launched the Manufacturing PA initiative, which links job training to career pathways that ensures training will lead to careers with higher pay and opportunities for advancement.

Through Manufacturing PA, the 2017-18 budget partners the commonwealth's research universities and industrial resource centers to accelerate manufacturing technology advancement and adoption, foster manufacturing innovation and commercialization, and build a 21st century workforce.

The partnership, according to the budget, will create or retain 6,000 manufacturing jobs, leverage nearly $30 million in matching funds and provide $950 million of economic impact for manufacturers.

Wolf has proposed establishing a new apprenticeship grant program to ensure workers - those leaving the K-12 education system and those transitioning into a new sector - can receive training aligned to business workforce needs.

The initiative will be funded with revenue recovered by Pa. Department of Community and Economic Development from companies that fail to live up to previous commitments made when they received state assistance.

Businesses would be able to seek grant funding of up to $2,000 for each apprentice employed pursuant to an apprenticeship agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship in the United States Department of Labor.

Tax credits to encourage high-tech manufacturing growth.

Following the recent enactment of a manufacturing tax credit, the budget includes $5 million for a manufacturing training-to-career grant program.

Through this new grant program, manufacturing businesses will receive funds to partner with technical programs and community colleges to develop new training programs that align with their workforce needs.

These programs will also offer apprenticeship programs, on-the-job training opportunities or paid internships, according to the budget.

Wolf has proposed a series of changes to the state's job creation grant programs in order to protect the jobs of Pennsylvanians.

One proposed change requires companies receiving state economic development grants to maintain any job created through receipt of a state grant for no less than five years, and to maintain operations within the state for no less than eight years.

Another change would require companies full payment of the state grant when they commit to create jobs but fails to make progress towards its obligations.

The state will require full repayment of the grant amount.

Wolf has also proposed requiring companies to fully repay a state grant and a 10 percent penalty if the company receives a grant and subsequently moves operations out of Pennsylvania."
1423,Roger Dupuis,2/7/2017 4:43 PM,"Companies that receive state funding for job creation would face stricter oversight under Gov. Tom Wolf's 2017-18 budget proposal, with revenue collected from companies that fall short helping fund a new apprenticeship program.

That effort is one of several that would affect manufacturers and other employers under Wolf's ongoing ""Jobs that Pay"" initiative, which also includes a proposal to hike the state's minimum wage from $7.25 to $12 an hour.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development approved nearly $1.1 billion in low-interest loans, tax credits, and grants for projects across the commonwealth, state statistics show, and secured private-sector commitments for the creation and retention of more than 245,000 full-time jobs.

Wolf wants to make sure those who receive state assistance are living up to their end of the bargain.

Pennsylvania's economic development projects ""Provide tremendous value to the state. But it is critical that they are monitored scrupulously to ensure that every taxpayer dollar is being spent wisely to provide maximum return on investment,"" the governor's budget presentation states.

DCED ""Already collects millions of dollars annually"" from companies that fail to meet their commitments after receiving state aid, according to the budget document.

Wolf wants to strengthen those policies, particularly for companies that relocate out of state after getting state money.

Companies receiving state economic development grants will be required to maintain any job created through receipt of a state grant for no less than five years, and to maintain operations in the state for no less than eight years.

Where a company commits to create jobs, and fails to make progress towards its obligations, the state will require full repayment of the grant amount.

If a company receives a grant from the state and subsequently moves operations out of Pennsylvania, DCED will require full repayment of the grant, as well as a 10 percent penalty.

DCED will revise the formula by which it pursues recovery in the event a company does not achieve its full commitment to prioritize job creation.

Finally, DCED will strengthen its contract language to implement the requirements above and ensure that all parties understand their responsibilities up front.

""Businesses that receive state funding to expand economic opportunity must be held accountable for the use of those dollars,"" the proposal adds.

Revenue recovered by DCED would fund a new apprenticeship grant program for workers - those entering the workforce from K-12 education as well as those transitioning into new sectors - to receive training aligned to workforce needs.

Under the program, businesses would be able to seek grant funding of up to $2,000 for each apprentice employed pursuant to an apprenticeship agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship in the U.S. Department of Labor.

The apprenticeships would be one component of a $12 million budget proposal called ""Manufacturing PA,"" which would link up Pennsylvania's research universities and its Industrial Resource Centers to accelerate manufacturing technology advancement in order to create or retain 6,000 manufacturing jobs.

5 million for a manufacturing training-to-career grant program, building on the recent enactment of a manufacturing tax credit to encourage high-tech manufacturing growth.

Through this new grant program, manufacturers would receive funds to partner with technical programs and community colleges to develop new training programs that align with their workforce needs.

Creation of a governor's middle class task force, composed of industry and policy experts as well as residents, to make future policy recommendations to improve the lives of working, middle class families.

Manufacturing is the third-largest industry in Pennsylvania, according to statistics presented by Wolf, employing over 550,000 workers with an average salary of $72,500.

His budget predicts the sector will continue to grow, reaching more than 584,000 workers in 2020."

There is a growing trend of high school students passing on traditional 4-year colleges and heading into apprenticeships instead.  Many are graduating without debt and their college education paid for by a company that sponsors the program. When they complete the 4-year program, there?s a career waiting for them.

Many of these jobs pay the same as what an average college graduate would earn.  ?There?s a workforce shortage out there right now ? so we grab them right out of high school, and put them in apprentice training program, get their career started pretty early,? said Steve Cona III, who is the CEO of Associated Builders and Contractors Florida Gulf Coast."

And after 20-plus years in the industry, Lisa Nakamura says, ?I used to get this sense when I was cooking: What good am I doing? Is it changing anyone?s world? I know that sounds so dramatic, but is it actually affecting anyone??  She?d gone from the French Laundry to The Herbfarm, cooking in New Orleans during Katrina, Seoul, Munich and beyond. At the end of November, she closed her Seattle restaurant Gnocchi Bar to become the chef instructor for Project Feast, a tiny, local nonprofit that seeks to empower refugee and immigrant cooks through job training.

1427,Stephenie Overman Feb 8,2/8/2017 1:04 PM,"Apprenticeships are typically associated with construction and manufacturing jobs, but they can also provide the skills needed for a wide range of hard-to-fill health care jobs.

The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship has developed apprenticeship programs for 40 health care occupations, including certified nursing assistant, laboratory technician, home health aide and licensed practical nurse.

The programs take an ""Earn while you learn"" approach by combining on-the-job learning, related instruction with a mentor and incremental wage increases.

Upon finishing the program, apprentices receive a nationally recognized, portable DOL certificate of completion.

The advantage of health care apprenticeships over an internship is that apprenticeships better reinforce classroom learning.

""An apprenticeship has a structure. There are modules in the classroom, then that is reinforced on the job,"" said Padma Arvind, director of Rutgers University's Healthcare Talent Development Center in New Brunswick, N.J. Two specialized programs rolled out in January in New Jersey.

One is for unemployed residents, ages 18 to 26, who did not complete high school.

They are training to become community health workers.

The second program aims to provide opportunities for domestic violence and sexual assault victims, military veterans, people with developmental and physical disabilities, and people living in transitional housing after incarceration.

They are receiving dual training to become certified home health aides and certified nursing assistants.

The programs are the result of collaboration by the development center, which is part of Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, the DOL, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and health care employers.

Previously, individuals were simply trained and placed into a pilot program, Arvind said, but ""We got feedback from employers who felt people needed on-the-job training"" as well as classroom instruction.

She helped develop the curriculum and job-training guidelines that were approved by the DOL and are now being used by other states as well.

""We're creating a new standard for public health workers. We work with the candidate, the supervisor, with HR. The employer is committed to paying the candidate,"" she said.

Successful apprentices receive certification that shows they have achieved core competencies in public health care.

Cetronia Ambulance Corps, in South Whitehall, Pa., is using apprenticeships to address the region's shortage of emergency medical technicians and paramedics.

Cetronia worked with the Lehigh Valley Workforce Development Board and Pennsylvania CareerLink Lehigh Valley to launch Pennsylvania's first four-year EMT/paramedic apprenticeship program.

The first two apprentices started in March 2016, according to Shawn McGovern, Cetronia's director of human resources.

""We started with two to make sure we could properly manage it, to make sure it was good for us and for the people coming on board. Because it's new, we had to make sure we were doing things correctly.""

The apprentices took classes, paid for by the state, through Lehigh Carbon Community College and the Emergency Medicine Institute at Lehigh Valley Hospital, two nights a week for six months, McGovern said.

At the same time, they started in entry-level positions at Cetronia.

""We brought them in while they started school to get used to our culture. We could train them on a few things, such as how to safely operate vehicles and in soft skills like customer service,"" he said.

""We started them from the ground up. It was a big help for us.""

Once they received their Pennsylvania EMT licenses, they began work as EMTs at Cetronia.

""It's an opportunity to grow with us. They can improve themselves, get better positions with the company and better pay obviously,"" McGovern said.

For Cetronia, the program is a good recruitment tool, he added.

""It gets our name out there to people who are displaced from other industries who are interested in health care but never knew how to get into it.""

1428,Staff,2/8/2017 1:42 PM,"Ferndale - The state's largest skilled trades union on Wednesday announced a new agreement with Detroit designed to expand career opportunities in the field for city residents.

The Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights has pledged that 25 percent of all first-year apprentices in the training program will be Detroit residents.

""With the amount of work we see coming into Detroit, the numbers are doable,"" Mike Jackson, executive secretary-treasurer of the carpenters union, said during a news conference inside the Detroit Area Carpentry Apprentice Training School in Ferndale.

""If you want to be a real carpenter today, you need real training. You need a four-year program if you are going to do the job,"" he said.

""It's a perfect time to come back to the trade. We want to be a positive part of that turnaround.""

Under the agreement, the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters Local 687, Local 1234 and Local 1045 will triple the number of Detroit residents trained to be carpenters over the next decade.

Together the three unions currently represent about 4,400 members.

Today, the union's locals have 283 members who are Detroit residents.

Within 10 years, that number will expand to 849 under the agreement.

The average salary for a certified journeyman is $28 to $32 per hour, plus benefits, Jackson added.

Jackson said Wednesday that the carpenters union is also working to expand its training centers by adding three more in the state, including one in Detroit.

""This agreement is the most comprehensive plan in the state to train residents for careers in the skilled trades,"" Mayor Mike Duggan added in a statement released Wednesday.

""Detroit residents should directly benefit from all of the construction in the city.""

The new partnership is part of the Detroit Skilled Trades Employment Program.

The city intends to partner with local unions and their Joint Apprentice Training Committees to set annual goals to increase the number of Detroit members.

Richard Belue, 26, of Detroit, is slated to complete his four-year training program at the Ferndale center in June and become a journeyman.

The new commitment to bring in more Detroit residents is sorely needed.

""It's going to open up a lot of doors for a lot of people that didn't have that opportunity,"" said Belue, who has been working on construction tied to the Little Caesars Arena project downtown.

""The most important thing is to give those people a chance.""

Duggan first unveiled the new effort to ensure Detroiters apprenticeship spots in December.

At that time, Plumbers Local 98, the Mechanical Contractors Association of Detroit and the Joint Apprenticeship Committee announced that at least 25 percent of all new apprentices to Local 98 will be Detroit residents.

The program was introduced as a solution to hefty fines brought against contractors who failed to meet requirements laid out in an executive order from Duggan, which stated at least 51 percent of the workforce on construction projects funded by more than $3 million of public money must be ""Bona-fide Detroit residents.""

The city's Department of Human Rights, which oversees that order, will also monitor compliance with unions participating in skilled trades employment effort.

Contractors and subcontractors using participating locals will not be subject to noncompliance fees that have been assessed in the city for major development projects not meeting hiring requirements, namely the arena project, said Portia Roberson, who heads the city's human rights office.

In the last 18 months, the city has collected close to $1 million in fees for noncompliance.

Those dollars go into workforce training efforts, Roberson said."
1432,Staff,2/8/2017 2:33 PM,"This piece was coauthored with Shea Gopaul, Executive Officer at the Global Apprenticeship Network.

With an estimated 200 million people globally out of work and forty percent of the world's people either underemployed or in vulnerable forms of employment unemployment remains a critical policy challenge Governments globally need to solve.

In reading publications like Forbes one hears corporates spanning the globe frustrated that they have job openings, yet they lack the skilled people required to fill them.

Why do companies struggle to find the right talent, despite the fact that we have never been better educated as a society? It all points to a major mismatch between the skills our students are being taught and their relevance to the employment market.

Something fundamentally does not, and is not working in the way we educate and train our young people to get them into the workforce.

Getting America back to work and repairing the 'rust belt' are key themes of President Donald Trump's administration, which promises 25 million new jobs, signalling this issue as one of its top priorities.

While education and training models and methods have traditionally been determined by the public sector, we are beginning to catch on that the most successful education and training systems are those which seek to align classroom lessons with the needs of industry and local employers.

Parents have always sought to guide their children's career paths, but as the pace of change and the nature of work perennially evolves and quickens, the question of whether or not a child's chosen subjects of study will translate to a job can be answered with hope but not certainty.

In today's world of automation and global supply chains, education and employment no longer take on linear paths - jobs can quickly change and so do their requirements.

The methodical and considered processes of bureaucracies are critiqued as too slow to adapt to the pace of change.

If there is to be reform to the education and training system, the public sector will need support, and this support should come from the main beneficiary of the education and training sector - employers.

Collaboration between the public and the private sector stakeholder is essential to developing a system that works for students and employers and that allows education and training opportunities to be as diverse and flexible as talent and jobs demand.

The world is filled with a variety of jobs requiring all kinds of people and skill sets.

The nodes and pathways currently available in education and training sector fails to properly reflect this diversity.

What can this administration do to deliver on the promise of new jobs, without expanding government or federal spending? One solution lies in an age-old practice with origins in medieval times but which has managed to endure through innovating and adapting across numerous sectors, countries, and cultures - the humble apprenticeship.

Regular workforce studies shows us that the apprenticeship model works - countries with strong apprenticeship systems have robust economies due to a skilled workforce, and less than half the rate of youth unemployment found in the U.S. Take Switzerland for example, only 30% of youth take the academic path, while the vast majority, 70% follows the apprenticeship route."
1434,PR Newswire,2/9/2017 9:40 AM,"SEATTLE, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ - The Washington State Apprenticeship Training Council approved the state's first Youth Apprenticeship program for the local aerospace and advanced manufacturing industries.

This program will provide high school students with an opportunity to earn tuition-free college credit, high school credit for graduation completion, 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, and mentorship from industry professionals.

Youth Apprenticeship Washington is ""a direct bridge from high school into industry and it provides a diverse pipeline of applicants. Youth Apprenticeship in Washington holds the promise of employing thousands of high school students across numerous high demand industries over the next several years,"" said Lynn Strickland, AJAC's Executive Director.

With the nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs opening in the next ten years, the industry is facing a shortfall of skilled labor, particularly from young adults.

""We're focusing on creating more opportunities to connect young people with great careers,"" said Governor Jay Inslee during the 2016 Youth Apprenticeship Summit.

He added, ""We know that a four-year track is not the only way to succeed in our state. And for too long we have been creating this implicit tacit message to our youth."" Apprentices on average, earn $300,000 more in their lifetime compared to non-completers and in Washington, manufacturers earn over $87,000 a year with zero college debt.

AJAC's Youth Apprenticeship program works directly with local-area employers who currently partner with AJAC for adult apprenticeship.

These employers have expressed the need for high school students, particularly those already in career and technical education programs, because they make good candidates for entry-level employment when coupled with an apprenticeship model of post-secondary education.

The first cohort of Youth Apprentices will launch on February 23, 2017 during Youth Apprenticeship Signing Day.

About AJAC: The Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee launched in August 2008 with an investment from Washington State to skill-up the state's aerospace and advanced manufacturing workforce.

AJAC develops and implements several high-growth, high-demand occupations through registered apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, and pre-apprenticeship programs."

The announcement came at a fitting time during National Apprenticeship Week, and it appears that the national drive to encourage companies to implement apprenticeship schemes has certainly paid off!

In 2015/16 just fewer than 25,000 people started a construction apprenticeship across England, Scotland and Wales, with the CITB funding over 8,400 employers which supported 24,600 apprenticeships, with 57 million provided as part of funding grants. For every apprentice that a company employs, the CITB has up to 10,250 of funding available, and research conducted in February suggests that 179,000 new workers are needed over the course of the next five years, so it is important that these figures continue to increase.  ?These figures show that more employers than ever before are taking on apprentices,? commented Sarah Beale, the Chief Executive of the Construction Industry Training Board. ?These record numbers are made possible by increased awareness of the opportunities available, including through the industry-led Go Construct website. We are also working to improve the quality of apprenticeships, with CITB supporting construction employers to develop 31 new Apprenticeship Standards to meet the changing needs of our industry.?"

1459,Staff,3/18/2017 1:05 PM,"President Trump met this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

One of the things President Trump talked about was Germany's successful apprenticeship program.

We often think about apprenticeship programs as being something you do for a blue collar job, which is true but Germany's apprenticeship aren't focused exclusively on blue collar work.

Teenagers often do a combined academic and practical program, where they may attend school part time and work part time.

This comes after Salesforce's Marc Benikoff challenged President Trump to create 5 million apprenticeships within the next five years, and Trump replied, ""Let's go for that 5 million.""

The United States typically pushes all children towards college, even though only around 69 percent of high school graduates attend college at all, and the ""6-year graduation rate was 58 percent at public institutions, 65 percent at private nonprofit institutions, and 27 percent at private for-profit institutions."" This means a lot of students who we are pushing towards college won't ever graduate and they are much less likely to be participating in the workforce.

Apprenticeship programs train people for all types of jobs-blue collar and white collar-while they are still in high school.

This means that if you aren't inclined towards a university education, you still can be prepared for a career.

In Germany, youth unemployment in 2014 was 7.8 percent, compared to over 14 percent in the US for the same time period.

NPR highlighted some of the aspects of the German apprenticeship program, and told the story of Robin Dittmar.

Dittmar loved airplanes but didn't have good enough grades to make it into a pilot training program.

His grades were high enough to get into an apprenticeship program.

Less-than-perfect school grades dashed Dittmar's dream of becoming a commercial pilot.

They were good enough to earn him a coveted apprenticeship slot with Lufthansa Technik, the technical arm of Europe's largest airline, responsible for aircraft maintenance and repair across the globe.

One-third of the way through his three-and-a-half years of training at Lufthansa technical headquarters in Hamburg, Dittmar is honing the skills required to become an aircraft mechanic - and all-but-guaranteeing himself a job.

US students don't have the option to take that kind of path until after they have finished high school.

In Switzerland, global insurance company Zurich found it difficult to staff their US divisions-so they wanted to import their apprenticeship program to the United States.

About 70-80 percent of Swiss students opt for an apprenticeship model, even when preparing for a white collar career.

Students take academic subjects while working and come out prepared for either further education or a job.

A long time proponent of apprenticeships and the skilled trades, former Dirty Jobs host, Mike Rowe, started a foundation which encourages apprenticeships and hard work.

Rowe recently testified before congress about the ""Widening skills gap"" which he hopes to help alleviate through vocational training.

The Fair Labor Standards Act has strict rules regarding pay for internships, which keeps internship numbers down.

We have a very strange system where it's legal to charge students thousands of dollars for a class that won't prepare them for a job, but we won't let them work for free in a program that will prepare them for a job.

Think about that: It's okay to pay for a class, but not okay to learn something for free, if it benefits a company even a little bit.

This isn't an official White House announcement, and no bills have been submitted to congress, but the fact that people are talking about moving towards an apprenticeship model is a good thing."

Since December, the Washington County Technical High School senior has worked at Jay Reece Prepaid, a cellular sales and mobile-repair company, earning on-the-job experience and training through the Youth Apprenticeship Maryland program.  ""It's honestly everything I could ask for,"" the 18-year-old said of working at the North Burhans Boulevard shop, which doubles as a Boost Mobile retailer.

Before attending Tech High, Brandon said he was struggling to figure out what he wanted to do after high school, but the school's computer repair and networking program jumped out at him.  ""As soon as I got here, I figured out technology was my calling,"" he said.

Baiyewu is operating a pre-apprenticeship program being offered by Great Lakes, but said he plans to restart First Choice course work as soon as Human Asset Development Corp. ? the new nonprofit formed to oversee the program ? receives its official tax-free nonprofit status from the federal government."
1471,Nick Rahaim,3/20/2017 11:58 AM,"As unions nationwide seek to stem the tide of declining membership, organized labor in the North Bay has launched a new effort to make apprenticeships in the trades more accessible to individuals without related work experience or a union connection.

The 10-week, 120-hour course, free for participants, provides education and skills training to anyone interested in pursuing an apprenticeship in one of 14 building trade unions.

""There hasn't been a pipeline for people to get into the building trades,"" said Bill Scott, co-director of the North Bay Trades Introduction Program.

""It's always been word of mouth.""

The new outreach effort addresses a problem of both perception and reality that unionized trades are grappling with, said Les Proteau, the other TIP co-director.

Craftspeople have been predominantly men and often get into union apprenticeship programs because of family members with connections.

""It used to be that you had to know a guy,"" Proteau said, who added that he got into the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades through his father who was also a member of that union.

""But people who go through this program now know a guy.""

The North Bay TIPs program kicked off in April 2016 with a $349,000 grant from the state Employment Development Department.

The funds were created by the California Clean Energy Jobs Act, approved by voters in 2012.

The training gives priority to women, people from disadvantaged backgrounds and veterans.

The free training includes first aid, CPR and Occupational Safety and Health Administration certifications, hands-on instruction with tools and materials at union worksites and training centers.

The North Bay Building Trades Councils, which oversees the program, has agreements with local unions to give priority to TIP graduates for apprenticeships.

Scott said the goal is to place at least 65 percent of TIP graduates into apprenticeship programs, a number that they're on pace to beat.

In July, 19 people completed the first 10-week program held at the College of Marin.

The second group of 14 students at Napa Valley College completed the program last month.

The third cohort of 18 meets regularly at Santa Rosa Junior College and includes more women than the two prior groups.

In a classroom Wednesday at the Redwood Empire Electrical Workers Joint Apprenticeship Training Center in Santa Rosa, students from their late teens to late 30s helped each other with math problems.

They were halfway through the ""Boot camp"" to start the program, including a 7 a.m. start at Santa Rosa Junior College.

The typical schedule for the building trades job is established at the beginning to weed out anyone who can't show up on time, Scott said.

The math equations in Wednesday's session caused Jordan Berry some frustration, but the 27-year-old Petaluma resident was thankful for the opportunity to practice.

Last year, she applied for an apprenticeship program with the United Steelworkers but failed the math test.

When she saw the flier for North Bay TIP she jumped on the chance to improve her skills.

Berry currently works at the Lagunitas Brewing Co.'s taproom in Petaluma.

She likes her job and co-workers, but she said it's not a career.

Instead of taking on student loans to go back to school, she hopes to land an apprenticeship with the International Union of Operating Engineers to become a heavy-equipment operator."

1478,Staff Report,3/20/2018  9:00 AM,"At the request of President Trump, the United States Department of Labor is expected to soon release new guidelines related to apprenticeship programs, including a rule that would allow private industry and unions to create and certify apprenticeship programs ? a role traditionally played by the Department of Labor or state agencies.  Cornell University?s Esta Bigler, who directs the Labor and Employment Program at the Industrial and Labor Relations School, says that apprenticeship programs are an essential part of the U.S. economy, but that government oversight is needed to avoid exploitation by companies. Bigler is a current member of the New York State Apprenticeship and Training Council, a body that sets standards for and monitors the performance of apprenticeship programs in New York state.

Bigler says:  ?If industries are allowed to manage apprenticeships without government oversight ? either state or federal, companies may use the programs to get cheap labor and fail to provide students with the skills they need to continue in the industry. It is an easy way for students to be exploited.  ?There are also implications for diversity and inclusion in industries with apprenticeship programs. In New York, the state Department of Labor and the Apprenticeship and Training Council ask how many women and minorities are graduating from apprenticeship programs and ask questions when we see these numbers slipping. There is still a long way to go, but we need the hand of government to make progress."

Key Provisions in Omnibus Appropriations Bill:

Apprenticeships:  Apprenticeship is a proven workforce development strategy that helps Americans both earn wages and learn skills. The omnibus appropriations bill includes a 53 percent increase above the Fiscal Year 2017 funding level for apprenticeship programs that will help to expand opportunities for family sustaining jobs. 

Office of Labor Management Standards:  The omnibus appropriations bill includes a 5.2 percent increase in funding for the Department of Labor?s Office of Labor Management Standards, which promotes democratic rights of rank-and-file labor union members and labor-management transparency through reporting and disclosure requirements for labor unions and their officials, employers, and labor relations consultants.

Veterans? Employment and Training Service:  The omnibus appropriations bill includes a 5.7 percent increase in funding for the Department of Labor?s Veterans? Employment and Training Service (VETS), including: $5 million for the Transition Assistance Program; $5 million for Jobs for Veterans State Grants; and $5 million for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program.   

Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA):  The omnibus appropriations bill includes an $80 million increase in funding for WIOA, which is designed to strengthen and improve America?s public workforce system and help get Americans, including youth and those with significant barriers to employment, into high-quality jobs and careers and help employers hire and retain skilled workers.  The Department of Labor looks forward to working with our nation?s governors to extend flexibility to empower those at the local level.

Tip Pooling:  The omnibus appropriations bill includes a bipartisan statutory provision to ensure that workers in the back of the house (i.e., cooks, bussers, dishwashers) can participate in tip pools in appropriate circumstances. Importantly, this same provision makes clear that employers themselves cannot keep tips."

Nation Ford High School student Jessie Whyte, 16, is learning to assemble tax returns and work with clients at the Bernie N. Ackerman CPA firm in Rock Hill.

""It's a real world experience. It's not like in school where everything is given to you,"" she said.

Whyte is one of many local students who are working while in school, through apprenticeships to see what a career is like while gaining new skills.

Through Apprenticeship Carolina, a division of the S.C. Technical College System, employers sponsor apprenticeships, providing on-the-job training to help students forge a career path, according to the program's website.

Apprenticeships are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and meet national training standards.

Apprentices are paid for their work and their pay increases as they meet benchmarks outlined by the employer, according to Apprenticeship Carolina.

BNA has offered internships for local students for many years, but recently formalized their program through Apprenticeship Carolina, said Susan Brackett, work-based learning coordinator for the Fort Mill school district.

Brackett vets students who are interested in a field to find the few who are qualified for an apprenticeship, then helps match them with a company.

Whyte said having that level of responsibility has taught her to be independent and learn to double-check her work.

Whyte, who joined BNA in November 2015, said she also answers phones and works with happy and upset clients.

""It's really good to put yourself out there. You meet a lot of people and learn how to interact well with them.""

Whyte works 20 hours a week and attends high school full time.

""I've learned to balance it well,"" she said.

""I'm more prepared to go into the world. It shows you that you can't choose everything. When you grow up, you have to work, and it will be crazy and stressful.""

South Carolina is pushing for more students to be college and career ready, with an emphasis on gaining skills, said Ryan Brown, chief communications officer for the S.C. Department of Education.

He said South Carolina has been successful in bringing companies and jobs here, but ""Our students don't have the skills and knowledge to fill them.""

That's where the apprenticeship program comes in, Brown said.

He said the program has grown exponentially in the last five years and has expanded from technical college into high schools.

""This program helps companies out as well. are learning new skills, getting career certified and getting paid.""

Those benefits and the opportunity to work with his hands are what drove Nation Ford graduate Caleb Beach, now 21, to take on an apprenticeship through Schaeffler Group North America in Fort Mill, a leading engineering partner and supplier to major automobile manufacturers.

He said through making fixtures, dies, molds and other tools used in manufacturing, he has learned the importance of precision.

Apprentices learn the basics and later split their time between school and work, said Beach, who has since graduated.

""I would go from learning in school and that same day taking what I learned and incorporating it into actual work,"" he said.

Schaeffler's apprentices also work with a mentor on the job after they finish school.

Apprenticeships are common for Schaeffler, a company with European roots, said Robert Nefermann, segment leader.

Nefermann started with the company as an apprentice in Germany and worked his way up.

He transferred 12 years ago to the U.S. Nefermann said apprenticeships provide students with a chance to grow a career, but also gives the company a way to recruit young talent.

Ackerman said BNA, a small firm founded in Rock Hill, benefits from adding quality students to their team.

""Apprenticeships are a better way to recruit for us. When we get someone from high school, our goal is to hire them full time.""

Apprenticeship programs also have helped students understand what careers entail.

Apprenticeship Carolina reports that across the nation, registered apprenticeship programs have been established for more than 950 occupations.

BNA is one of the few accounting firms to offer training to high school students, Brackett said.

""It's good for students in high school to get a taste of the real world and different careers,"" Ackerman said.

""It's better to find out if you don't like something in high school than in your third year of college when you're already majoring in something. You don't want to be in a job for 40 years where you're unhappy.""

Brown said many options exist to students who choose a career path with technical education and certification.

""We want to come out of a two- or four-year degree program with a job, but we're seeing more and better jobs coming out of the two-year path than those coming out of a four-year degree,"" he said.

He said a mindset shift needs to occur as student loan debt becomes a growing concern.

The opportunity to learn and be paid meant Beach didn't graduate with a loan debt to pay.

""Work-based learning is one of the best opportunities I was ever offered."""

She hadn't been able to land a tech job on her own, in part because she had spent most of her first year after college teaching, rather than programming.

""A lot of people think that finding jobs in programming is easy right now. But companies are looking for a lot of experience, which is hard to get,"" she says.

The $11 hourly wage she received during the class helped her and her husband pay their rent, and meant she didn't have to take on any additional debt for the skills tuneup.

Katz was placed at a programming job at a finance company after she graduated from Revature in March.

The company may find it difficult to keep its graduates employed for two years, and thus not be able to recoup its investment in the students, for example.

The students Revature wants to recruit may eventually find it more profitable to fund their own education and then take whatever job they want; fully trained starting software engineers often command salaries in excess of $70,000 a year.

Despite the risks, Revature is one of a growing number of coding boot camps and colleges offering free tuition to students willing to share a percentage of their earnings after graduation.

The number of other companies offering apprenticeships - where new workers learn while they earn a reduced salary - has also risen sharply, says Robert Lerman, an American University economist who studies apprenticeships.

The U.S. Department of Labor says there were 505,000 Americans in formal apprenticeships in the fall of 2016, up from 375,000 in the fall of 2013.Many other countries, such as Germany and Australia, have large apprenticeship programs, notes Lerner.

""Apprenticeships are in the air"" here in the U.S., he adds, partially as a result of the growing backlash against big student debt.

Joe Vacca, chief marketing officer for Revature, says that so far there's no sign the company will have any trouble finding new students willing to make the two-year commitment - nor keeping its graduates employed.

""Because of the pressure on immigration, more companies are looking at how to hire U.S. citizens,"" he said.

""Revature is a great model"" for helping Americans get in-demand skills, says Rick O'Donnell, CEO of Skills Fund, an Austin-based lender to students at other coding boot camps.

Revature only profits if its students are wanted by other employers, so it is highly motivated to make sure students get the best training possible, he says.

It at least gives students who want training without debt an option.

""Some students are very debt-averse,"" he adds.

""The risk of knowing they will have a job might be worth making a little less the first few years,"" he added."

When you hear the term ""collecting waste,"" you may not think of an exciting career and that's exactly why Mayor Greg Stanton says the launch of the Phoenix Public Works Apprenticeship Program for Solid Waste Equipment Operators is needed.  ""Yes, there's a negative stereotype that we're dealing with and yes, we're trying to fix that by bringing a lot of new people to the table,"" he said.

San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee joined Phoenix city officials to launch the program similar to the one that he helped establish in the city by the bay.  ""You know, as I've had the privilege of being the director of public works in the past, one of the things when you work alongside people who pick up garbage every day and get graffiti out of the walls and clean the streets and ally ways, the one word that comes to mind is 'respect,'"" he said."

ECC?s Center for Workforce Development will receive $239,550 to develop apprenticeship programs with area manufacturers including Aerofil Industries, ATRO Engineering Systems, Clemco Industries, Graphic Packaging, G.H. Tool and Mold, Homeyer Precision and Texwrap Packaging Systems.

MORAP is designed to provide workers with on-the-job training at their current employer, in addition to classroom and hands-on training through one of three ECC programs; Industrial Engineering Technology, Precision Machining or Welding.  ?ECC is in the position to provide the state-of-the-art training for our area,? says Joel Doepker, Vice President of External Relations. ?We are fortunate to have the state recognize the importance of retaining and training a vibrant workforce.?"

The plans to create the New Jersey Apprenticeship Network would include a new path for state residents to enter high-skilled careers through paid apprenticeships that may include college credit.  The new training center in Edison will serve as New Jersey?s location for education and training for over 1,000 carpenter apprentices.  ?A stronger and fairer New Jersey starts with creating a workforce that is ready and trained to build a world-class infrastructure for our state,? Murphy said, according to a news release."
1520,Dan Decker,3/29/2018  6:39 PM,"Apprenticeships are partnerships between the corporate world, public schools, and technical schools. While this is pretty common in most countries, there are not a great deal of students taking advantage of these programs. We sit on the lower end with only 7 percent as many as what England had in 2012. Many students in these programs work 15-20 hours a week as an apprentice during their junior, senior, or both years. This partnership allows students to gain experience in the field while achieving academic credit at the same time.  Apprenticeship programs are becoming very viable programs as the amount of college debt continues to rise. College debt in America exceeds $1 trillion and has surpassed credit card debt, according to a report by the Center for American Progress. The average debt faced by college graduates is between $26,000 and $30,000, which makes it one of the biggest obstacles facing young people as they attempt to gain traction in a tough economy. Many of the students in apprenticeship programs graduate high school ready to enter the working world, and some are even employed with companies who will pay for them to go to college while they work, allowing them to graduate debt free. Apprenticeships are a key part of the work-based learning in America.

Currently in America, youth apprentices make between $10-$15 an hour working with local manufacturers two afternoons a week and spend three afternoons taking taking dual credit courses with their school and local community college. These students generally work enough to earn a Journeyman Certificate from the U.S. Department of Labor making the employable across the country. In the communities across America that are participating in these programs, the push to include them in public education is coming from local manufacturers-especially those familiar with the European apprenticeship model.  There are barriers to the growth of this type of program that those interested will have to work through."
1521,Roy Maurer Mar 3,3/3/2017 1:04 PM,"Television personality Mike Rowe, former host of the ""Dirty Jobs"" television program about hands-on, blue-collar work, told a Congressional panel discussing career and technical education and the skilled trades, ""You've got to make work cool again.""

Rowe-CEO of the mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which provides scholarships to study skilled trades-addressed a House Education and the Workforce subcommittee Feb. 28 as Congress prepares to consider new legislation that would reauthorize federal funding for career and technical education and training.

Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., the chief sponsor of failed 2016 bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, said he would be reintroducing the legislation shortly.

The 2016 reauthorization bill passed the House of Representatives 405-5 but was not taken up in the Senate.

The law provides over $1 billion in federal support for career and technical education programs across the country, including support for integrated career pathways programs.

""These programs serve more than 11 million students-helping them receive knowledge, skills and real-world experience in fields ranging from health care and law enforcement to information technology and manufacturing,"" said subcommittee chair Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind. ""It's a worthwhile investment in growing a skilled workforce, preparing students for postsecondary education or the workplace, and helping hardworking individuals-particularly younger individuals-achieve their goals in life.""

Rokita said he is ""Very optimistic"" about the proposal being signed into law to counter the growing national skills gap.

""This need for skilled labor exists in a number of critical industries,"" he said.

""In manufacturing alone, six out of 10 positions go unfilled because of the skills gap, and 84 percent of manufacturers agree there is a talent shortage. What's worse is that if current projections continue, more than 6 million jobs will remain unfilled by the year 2020."" Panelists before the committee agreed that a major reason for this divide is that too many young people entering the labor force are not only unprepared for these critical jobs but are actually persuaded not to consider what used to be called vocational education and the skilled trades professions that result from it.

""Vocational education is still missing from an overwhelming majority of high schools,"" Rowe said.

""Bills like the one before this committee still meet resistance, in part because millions of Americans still view a career in the trades as some kind of 'vocational consolation prize.' It's a bias as misguided as any other prejudice with us today, and it poses a clear and present danger to our country's overall economic security.""

He added that the skills gap will never close ""If we keep telling people a four-year degree is their only hope of being successful.""

Rowe suggested a nationwide public relations facelift coordinated among employers, government, schools and nonprofits to elevate career and technical training and skilled trades jobs, similar to the 1950s Keep America Beautiful anti-littering campaign.

""You have to change the image of the opportunity.""

Rowe, one of the keynote speakers at SHRM's Annual Conference & Exposition in summer 2016, told conference attendees his story about how the San Francisco Sewers offered a lesson in appreciating workers who perform seemingly thankless jobs that are critical to the day-to-day lives of millions of Americans.

""Employers are key partners in supporting career and technical education through providing real-world learning experiences for students.""Through their interactions with industry professionals,.

""Students realize their coursework is relevant, and does translate into meaningful career skills and job opportunities,"" said Janet Goble, director of career and technical education for the Canyons School District in Sandy, Utah.

Goble told the committee about successful partnerships among her district, the state's office of economic development, the Salt Lake Community College system and local employers.

The partners created a pathway for students to become diesel technicians, starting with dual enrollment courses in high school and college to learn industry skills.

They applied the same model with medical device manufacturers.

""The industry partners have donated many hours of their time to job shadow experiences for our students, participating in numerous career fairs and enlightening counselors about this viable career pathway,"" she said.

Perkins funds were instrumental in developing work-based learning opportunities for students and adults looking to retool their skills, she added.

Glenn E. Johnson, a workforce development leader at BASF, a multinational chemicals manufacturing corporation headquartered in Ludwigshafen, Germany, explained that alignment between the education system and the business community is critical to mitigate the impact of the national skills gap.

""BASF is taking a more engaged approach to workforce development and is focusing on pipeline relationship management,"" he said.

That includes ""Direct involvement in all stages of workforce preparation. Surveys report that 52 percent of all teenagers say they have no interest in a manufacturing career. However, the data also reports that the most influential factor for students deciding what career to pursue is. This drives our need to do more to familiarize these workforce potentials with jobs in manufacturing technology.""

Helping grade-school students develop an interest in science.

Positioning high-school students in skilled science, technology, engineering and mathematics career paths.

Correcting misconceptions about pay, lifestyle and future job availability projections.

Asking employee resource groups to serve as ambassadors focused on diverse populations.

""Apprenticeships provide a realistic job preview before students finish their actual education,"" Johnson said.

""They not only increase the direct applied skills for , but the experience pushes career and technical education awareness to their friends.""

1527,PR Newswire,3/30/2017 9:41 AM,"SEATTLE, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ - The Washington State Apprenticeship Training Council approved the state's first Youth Apprenticeship program for the local aerospace and advanced manufacturing industries.

This program will provide high school students with an opportunity to earn tuition-free college credit, high school credit for graduation completion, 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, and mentorship from industry professionals.

Youth Apprenticeship Washington is ""a direct bridge from high school into industry and it provides a diverse pipeline of applicants. Youth Apprenticeship in Washington holds the promise of employing thousands of high school students across numerous high demand industries over the next several years,"" said Lynn Strickland, AJAC's Executive Director.

With the nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs opening in the next ten years, the industry is facing a shortfall of skilled labor, particularly from young adults.

""We're focusing on creating more opportunities to connect young people with great careers,"" said Governor Jay Inslee during the 2016 Youth Apprenticeship Summit.

He added, ""We know that a four-year track is not the only way to succeed in our state. And for too long we have been creating this implicit tacit message to our youth."" Apprentices on average, earn $300,000 more in their lifetime compared to non-completers and in Washington, manufacturers earn over $87,000 a year with zero college debt.

AJAC's Youth Apprenticeship program works directly with local-area employers who currently partner with AJAC for adult apprenticeship.

These employers have expressed the need for high school students, particularly those already in career and technical education programs, because they make good candidates for entry-level employment when coupled with an apprenticeship model of post-secondary education.

About AJAC: The Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee launched in August 2008 with an investment from Washington State to skill-up the state's aerospace and advanced manufacturing workforce.

AJAC develops and implements several high-growth, high-demand occupations through registered apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, and pre-apprenticeship programs."
1528,Editorial,3/30/2018  3:00 PM,"Every year Accenture adds 400 to 500 entry-level employees to its Chicago office. This year, for the first time, more of the new hires will come from City Colleges of Chicago than anywhere else. What's just as remarkable: Until two years ago, when it brought in five students from Wright College, the accounting giant did no recruiting from City Colleges. The latter-day discovery of community colleges is good for Accenture, providing a new source of talent as the labor market reaches full employment, particularly among university grads. It's perhaps even better for students who previously found the doors to a career in professional services locked.

Like a small but growing number of Chicago employers, Accenture got to this place by offering office-based apprenticeships. The concept is hardly new, of course. Apprenticeships in the skilled trades go back centuries. But they came to Loop high-rises and suburban corporate campuses only recently. Aon led the way after the company, along with Allstate and CNA, developed an insurance curriculum at Washington College. In 2016, it invited students to apply for a two-year apprenticeship. The first cohort of 25, chosen from 100 applicants, began in January 2017. They work 20 to 30 hours a week in support roles in tech, HR and insurance, and spend 10 to 15 hours a week in class. They are paid ""commensurate"" salaries and receive full benefits, including health care and paid tuition. With the addition of a second cohort in January, Aon now employs 50 apprentices. "

New Castle County Council on Tuesday will debate whether to change controversial rules regarding who can win pricey, public construction contracts.

County Executive Matt Meyer said loosening rules that require contractors have apprentices can save millions by increasing competition for those who want to do big-ticket county jobs as well as lead to more work being done by Delaware firms.

James Maravelias, president of the Delaware Building Construction Trades Council that represents 24 affiliated local unions, said the county is turning its back on training low-skilled workers.

County law requires any company bidding on a government contract worth more than $100,000 to have apprentices through a state-approved program or guarantee they will be by the time the contract begins.

Each year, the county has several such contracts through its capital spending plan, which appropriated about $50 million toward construction and land purchase projects this year.

New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer applauds a guest as he delivers his budget proposal to county council at the Louis L. Redding City/County Building Tuesday.

Construction companies partner with a state program to train apprentices.

Unions also administer apprenticeship programs that train workers through their member companies.

The apprenticeship requirement was created in 2008 along with a suite of other licensing and disclosure requirements for potential contractors.

The law passed with high praise from local union organizations who trumpet their apprenticeship model as a benefit of membership.

The Delaware chapter of the Association of Building Contractors, a group of mostly non-union contractors, sued the county, claiming the rules were unlawfully preventing participation by some of its 400 mostly nonunionized, industrial contractor firms.

The county is proposing to raise the threshold for jobs that require apprentices from $100,000 for contractors and $50,000 for subcontractors to $1 million for contractors and $500,000 for subcontractors.

It also allows for county officials to waive the requirement if no bidders meet the criteria.

Supporters feel raising the threshold will lead to more smaller outfits being able to win county contracts.

At the heart of that push is the longstanding complaint that there are no apprenticeship program for some construction trades.

The state divides construction workers into 26 categories under the prevailing wage law.

For 12 of those classifications, including masonry, tile setters and asbestos workers, the state has no approved program.

Because of this, those behind the proposed change feel many local contractors, especially smaller firms, are shut out of the possibility of working on such projects.

Many of those firms don't have a large enough, or inexperienced enough workforce to participate in apprenticeship programs, supporters of the changes argue.

Meyer's administration did a study comparing county contracting costs before and after the apprenticeship requirement came into law.

In the years since the requirement became law, 35 percent of county construction spending went to in-state contractors.

STORY: Builders say New Castle County rules are unfair.

State government has no such requirement and approximately 80 percent of its contracting work stays with in-state firms.

When the Bear library was built in 2012, the county requested bids for the millwork and casework twice and only received one bid each time from an out of state contractor, Rosen said.

Since the law, the county has received fewer bids, both in and out of state, for its work.

Overall, the county has received 25 percent fewer bids than before the requirement became law, Rosen said.

Hollins said he voted for the original requirement more than a decade ago to help minority workers get training and county business.

As an example citing administration figures, he said less than 1 percent of the county's current contractors are black-owned contractors.

58 percent of the wages to build the $31 million Route 9 library are being paid to out of state workers.

Maravelias accused those behind the push of ""Playing with the numbers"" in a way that fails to consider other economic factors on county contracting like the 2008 financial collapse.

He also argued that part of the reason for decreased interest from Delaware firms is because they have been concentrating on doing work out of state where more construction projects are taking place.

He said the effect of not having apprenticeships for all trades in Delaware is minimal because several local contractors participate in apprenticeship programs out of state.

In his view, the apprenticeship requirement demands the county work with contractors who care about education and that care filters into the work that gets done.

A construction worker makes his way through the job site at where the new library is being built off of Route 9 in New Castle on Wednesday afternoon.

Council President Karen Hartley-Nagle said she will vote against the proposal because she feels it would lead to higher county costs due to unsafe job sites and lower quality workmanship.

""Apprenticeships lead to good paying jobs, grow our middle class and ensure safe quality work,"" Harley-Nagle said in an emailed statement.

Councilman Timothy Sheldon unsuccessfully pushed legislation to close what he sees as a loophole in rules dictating the responsibilities of county contractors.

Meyer said he supports apprenticeships and the rule change will not affect the training of skilled workers and that hiring more in-state contractors will actually lead to more local apprenticeship opportunities.

The changes will be debated at the County Council's Executive Committee meeting at 4 p.m. The council will then vote on the proposed changes at its regular meeting at 6:30 p.m. Both meetings are scheduled at council chambers on the first floor of the City/County Building at 800 N. French St. in Wilmington."

Already, the Trump administration has followed through on the president's anti-immigration campaign rhetoric with several actions, most notably its two litigation-encumbered immigration bans.

Of greater impact, Trump has suspended an expedited approval process for H-1B visas, which the tech industry often relies on to bring highly talented foreigners to the U.S. And most recently, the administration issued a clarification on the wording of the program, stating that being a computer programmer alone ""Is not sufficient to establish the position as a specialty occupation.""

We've yet to see the exact impact this clarification will have on the next wave of H-1B visa applicants, but many in the tech industry are expecting this action will make it more difficult for lower-skill foreign tech workers - such as junior developers, network administrators, and quality assurance specialists - to receive documents necessary to work in the U.S. That is why some now believe that tech apprenticeships could receive a boost in interest from American tech companies.

""One of the biggest barriers is that employers must be willing to accept the idea of apprenticeship programs,"" says Charles Eaton, executive vice president of social innovation at CompTIA. ""Regardless of the H-1B program, the tech industry is still having to find talent. They are right now hiring from each other. Most of those job openings are filled by people who already have jobs.""

Already, companies like Yelp, Pinterest, and Atlassian have dabbled in apprenticeships as a way to get more women and people of color into their engineering ranks.

Regardless of the fate of the H-1B program, which brings in about 100,000 foreign workers to the U.S. each year, the talent shortage keeps growing.

By the year 2020, as many as one million programming jobs in the U.S. could go unfilled, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""Changes do suggest that companies are going to have to be more innovative in the ways that they go about finding talent for junior-level and entry-level programming positions,"" says Jeff Mazur, vice president of partnerships at LaunchCode, a nonprofit organization that runs an apprenticeship program.

LaunchCode, which has been around for three and a half years, claims to have started 700 tech careers through its programs.

The organization identifies talented individuals who have taught themselves tech skills through non-traditional routes, such as coding bootcamps, self-teaching, or LaunchCode's own courses.

The organization vets the individuals by interviewing them and having them take a technical assessment.

If they pass, LaunchCode will recommend them to its employer partners, of which there are 400, including companies like Boeing, General Electric, and Riot Games, Inc.'s 2016 Company of the Year.

""The tech industry relies heavily on candidates with four-year college degrees, and if we continue to rely entirely on those candidates, we're never going to close the gap,"" Mazur says.

Among the fastest growing tech apprenticeship programs in the U.S. is Apprenti.

Under the Obama administration, the Department of Labor in 2015 provided the funding that was used to create this pilot apprenticeship program through a grant that draws its money from fees paid for H-1B visas.

Apprenti works with notable Washington tech companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, to get workers like Farrow into the industry.

Apprenti, which launched in September 2016, identifies and vets talented individuals, with priority given to women, minorities, and veterans.

The program then recommends apprentices to companies as their needs arise.

Individuals involved with Apprenti are qualified to be trained for roles as software developers, web developers, project managers, Windows systems administrators, Linux systems administrators, network security administrators, and database administrators.

The apprentices undergo multiweek training, and if successful, they are given a yearlong contract by their companies, which pay Apprenti a placement fee.

Thus far, Apprenti has placed 40 apprentices, with plans to expand.

At its creation, the goal was to place 600 apprentices in Washington by 2020.

Accelerating that, Apprenti is franchising its model and planning to expand through other nonprofit organizations around the country with the goal of nationally placing at least 450 apprentices annually starting this year.

For the companies, the benefit is they bring someone who they can mold to their preferences at a financially friendly salary of $45,000 a year, says Jennifer Carlson, the executive director of the Washington Technology Industry Association Workforce Institute, which operates Apprenti.

""The company gets that financial benefit, the individual gets that training to become successful, and we've now created another body for the industry,"" Carlson says."

1615,Mai Hoang,4/27/2017  12:00 AM,"Last fall, Chris Nesmith spent two weeks in Germany learning about the country?s apprenticeship program.  Whether in a rural area or a large city, the program had a solid track record of putting students on a desired career path when they completed their secondary education.  ?You see education and the economy as one,? said Nesmith, director of West Valley High School?s Career and Technical Education program. ?There?s not this break between the two.?

That concept now is here: On Wednesday, three West Valley High School students signed agreements to participate in the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee?s new youth apprenticeship program.  Trevor Mackey, Osborne Rogers and Bradley Ethier will receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training with CubCrafters, Triumph Actuation Systems and Pexco Aerospace, respectively. They will also receive 150 hours of instruction. By graduation they will have not only their high school diploma, but also up to 15 college credits. They will have earned more than $22,000 in wages from their employer and will have nationally recognized journeyman credentials."
1616,Annie McGrew & Angela Hanks,4/27/2017  9:05 AM,"Luis Rivera has spent the past two decades struggling to find stable, family-sustaining work. Although he was released from prison in the 1990s after serving a two-year sentence, his criminal record still casts a long shadow over his employment prospects. As a result, Rivera has spent most his life piecing together dead-end, informal, and part-time jobs, and trying to support a family of four while earning minimum wage.  Rivera?s story is unfortunately far from unique. Today, as many as 1 in 3 Americans have a criminal record.  This has meant that each year, millions of people with criminal records struggle to find good jobs that make it possible for them to support their families and move on with their lives.  For people of color and those with disabilities, who face overwhelmingly disproportionate rates of incarceration, a criminal record is yet one more obstacle to employment in a labor market that already discriminates against these groups.

The challenges Rivera and millions of others in similar circumstances face do not need to be inevitable. Governments at all levels can take steps to improve the labor market attachment of the formerly incarcerated?beginning while they are still behind bars. Apprenticeship programs for the incarcerated, which combine on-the-job training with relevant classroom instruction, could significantly improve employment outcomes for returning citizens. This is especially true if participating inmates are earning wages for their time on the job. This brief argues that greater access to paid prison apprenticeship programs could effectively improve inmates? post-release outcomes, particularly for a group of individuals who already face significant barriers to labor market entry."

1637,Gregg Wartgow,4/6/2017 1:20 PM,"Landscaping companies and equipment dealers are hurting for employees, and Pennsylvania's secretary of agriculture is doing something about it.

Russell Redding, who served as agriculture secretary from 2009-2011 before being reappointed in May 2015, has directed a robust workforce development initiative designed to attract more workers to several dozen occupations in the agriculture and food industries.

Landscaping/groundskeeping workers and farm equipment technicians are on that list of occupations.

Sheely's background makes him ideally suited to the job.

He had served as director of the Lancaster County Workforce Investment Board where his team helped to develop an apprenticeship program for the manufacturing industry.

After going on hiatus to complete his doctorate, Sheely returned to public service a couple of years ago to help apply much of what had been done in manufacturing to the agriculture industry.

The latest effort is the development of a farm equipment technician apprenticeship program.

As a matter of fact, Sheely and his team have been working on it for a good year and a half.

While much progress is being made with the apprenticeship program, a few hurdles remain.

""We want to get the program registered through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry,"" Sheely points out.

Sheely says he and his team have been talking to a half-dozen dealers in the region who have been offering input and helping with product development.

The apprenticeship program is being designed with two pieces.

""We're designing this so advancement through the program is based on the demonstration of certain skills,"" Sheely explains.

Many apprenticeship programs can last three to four years, Sheely points out.

Sheely and his team have been reaching out to tech schools and high schools to promote the program and also ensure that the training they're providing is on target.

""We'd like to create a sort of 'pre-apprenticeship' so that what kids are learning in their high school mechanics classes would count as credit toward their completion of the apprenticeship program,"" Sheely says.

""We'll promote the apprenticeship program through Career Link from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry,"" Sheely says.

""That's the main place people go job hunting these days. Plus, the Pennsylvania Apprenticeship & Training Council is located within the Department of Labor & Industry, so there's a good connection which will help get the word out.""

Speaking of getting the word out, Sheely hopes to expand outreach to dealers and educators throughout Pennsylvania.

Right now the apprenticeship initiative is largely focused on two counties, Lancaster and Chester.

""We know there is a tremendous need across the Commonwealth, but it takes time to roll something like this out,"" Sheely cautions.

One dealer who has already been quite involved is Don Hoover.

So Hoover decided to invite agriculture secretary Redding to come to his dealership and talk about it.

Hoover also invited leaders from area trade schools, including Reading Area Community College and Delaware Valley College, as well as a dozen or so area employers from various ag-oriented industries that were all having a hard time finding employees.

Hoover is the owner of Binkley & Hurst, a multi-location equipment dealership with locations in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.

Binkley & Hurst sells numerous farm equipment brands including Case IH and AGCO, along with Gehl/Manitou construction equipment and Ferris, Simplicity and Stihl lawn and garden equipment.

""Guidance counselors told us they had no idea what great opportunities were available in the agriculture industry,"" Hoover recalls.

Hoover knew right then that two things needed to happen: 1) The right message needed to be conveyed to students, parents and educators, and 2) technician compensation had to be more in line with what competing industries were paying.

From there Hoover went to a local jobs fair to begin connecting with students and parents.

""About 600 middle school students and their parents came through,"" Hoover tells.

Hoover says farm equipment dealerships like his had been traditionally staffed by people who grew up on farms, although this is much less the case today.

""When you go from having to fix a piece of equipment with a pair of slip-joint pliers, an adjustable wrench and a hammer, to where most of the diagnostics on today's newer equipment has to be done with a laptop computer or some type of gadgetry we didn't have 20 or 30 years ago, it's a big change,"" Hoover points out.

That's why Hoover has been bringing in more new employees with two- or even four-year degrees.

""Ten years ago, nobody even knew what 'ag equipment mechatronics' was,"" he relates.

""Nowadays, it pretty much rules the industry. You'll have multiple computers on a given piece of farm machinery, such as a combine or spraying apparatus."" That requires a different skillset, while at the same time requiring many of the same traits dealers have always wanted in their technicians: mechanical aptitude, along with the willingness to work sometimes challenging hours in often challenging conditions.

""Internships require a certain amount of flexibility on the part of the employer,"" Hoover continues.

Compounding the complexity of the situation is the fact that the farm and outdoor power equipment industries are competing against many other industries for workers.

""If somebody wants to go out and wrench today, they can also look to the work truck industry or heavy construction equipment industry, for example, which in many cases pay 10-20% higher than the typical farm equipment dealership can pay,"" Hoover points out.

The farm equipment technician apprenticeship program-which Hoover helped to identify a need for and Sheely is now helping to bring to fruition-could help more young people find those opportunities in the farm equipment industry.

""So far everything is right on target,"" Sheely says."
1638,Gregory Goth,4/6/2017 12:37 PM,"Whether there exists a global shortage of software developers may be open to debate, but technologists on the forefront of discovering new talent say there is definitely a shortage of newly minted computing professionals who are ready to do production-quality work.

While the traditional route of the entry-level developer-obtaining a baccalaureate degree in computer science or a related engineering field-might seem to be the quickest path to the profession, some veterans of the industry say it is vital to re-think how new developers are trained.

Apprenticeship, might conjure images of guilded craftsmen or construction trades.

New approaches to apprenticeship are emerging that aim to provide talented, if not traditionally trained, computing professionals around the globe.

""I'm getting a lot of young people who are really smart and know that they know some things but not everything,"" said Joseph Gianzanti, Fort Lauderdale, FL-based chief information officer for Insurance Technologies LLC, which develops sales and regulatory automation platforms.

Gianzanti is an enthusiastic supporter of the apprenticeship program offered by St. Louis, MO-based LaunchCode.

""He was looking for people with the proper computer science background in St. Louis, and he realized that we were in an economy where, when you wanted a programmer, Company A basically stole from Company B, and vice versa,"" LaunchCode CEO Mark Bauer said.

""It was just a fundamental technology talent gap where the supply of candidates wasn't meeting the demand. The whole idea was there has to be a different way, there have to be people who have the aptitude and ability to teach themselves without a four-year computer science degree.""

While Bauer said LaunchCode has placed an apprentice as young as 16 and one aged 63, most are aged between 25 and 35, and seven out of 10 have a bachelor's degree.

""The ones who did have jobs were making about $20,000 a year and, assuming they got through the apprenticeship and into full-time employment, they ended up making more than $50,000 at that time.""

LaunchCode, which had placed 500 apprentices with hiring firms by the end of 2016, now operates in south Florida; Kansas City, KS: Providence, RI; Portland, OR, and Seattle, in addition to St. Louis.

Bauer said between 400 and 1,200 people apply for each class, and between 80 and 150 are accepted.

After 20 weeks' of instruction, each apprentice then spends an average of 90 days with a company matched to them by LaunchCode, earning about $15 an hour; at the end of the apprenticeship, they can either be hired full-time by their host firm or, as happens less often, find work elsewhere.

Bauer said slightly more than 80% of apprentices are hired by the firms at which they apprentice.

""If you think about a company hiring for these positions, it is very easy to say the bar is a four-year computer science degree, because it's an amazingly simple screening criteria,"" he said.

""But we have done all the screening for them, and we find that if you want to talk to a LaunchCode apprenticeship candidate, on average you'll talk to three and pick one of those three. It's an amazing level of efficiency because of the screening that's been done before the employer gets involved.""

In the U.K., the apprenticeship program goes further than hiring a majority of university graduates; it creates them while also introducing them to a hiring company's procedures and cultures.

The Tech Partnership consortium's degree apprenticeship program, launched in 2015, provides apprentices debt-free and salaried education and training funded by the government and participating business.

Gordon Kent, who helped the Tech Partnership while serving as director of emerging IT talent for Lloyds Banking Group, said the program had support from the very top of the British government from its conceptual inception-it got its start at a brainstorming meeting at the prime minister's offices at 10 Downing St. in London-and places the U.K. ahead of many other national technology training programs, in Kent's view.

""The most innovative thing we did with the program in London was we said they will work four days a week at the company and only one day a week will they be going to classes at the university,"" Kent said.

""The sponsoring company coordinates very carefully with the university. It was challenged by a lot of the universities at first, but we did it.""

Kent, a native of Long Island, NY, was so enthusiastic about the potential of apprentice programs that he returned to the U.S. in 2016 and started his own career development consultancy, ProgressiveCareer LLC, to facilitate apprenticeship as part of a viable recruiting stream.

The Obama administration provided more than $200 million under the ApprenticeshipUSA banner to launch apprenticeship programs, and a U.S. Commerce Department/Case Western Reserve University analysis of 13 such programs, including LaunchCode, revealed impressive returns on investment.

While Kent said the funding might be decreased to some extent or shifted elsewhere under the administration of President Donald Trump, he also said supporting apprenticeships thus far appears to be a bipartisan priority.

""I think what is lacking very often here is people who know how to make it work, who have the experience of doing an apprenticeship program. The potential is great. There hasn't been much traction yet, but there are a lot of good people working at it. I could spend 100% of my time on an effort like the Tech Partnership's, if all the pieces came together.""

No matter the scale of an apprenticeship program, technology executives say in the end the approach is all about finding viable alternatives in building the developer community and adding important new perspectives in the process.

Ryan Townsend, chief technology officer of Overland Park, KS-based educational analytics vendor Ad Astra Information Systems, who also praises the LaunchCode program, said planning to train apprentices he has brought in has helped improve the entire development process.

""We have found that they have actually pushed us as much as we have pushed them,"" Townsend said, ""Because they are very hungry and want to learn. It's forced us to guide them a little more than we had imagined, but at a higher level. It's not little nuts and bolts, but they ask questions like, 'What does this business do?' People with backgrounds beyond the technical sciences come in more naturally inquisitive about what the business is trying to accomplish, instead of 'What is this little piece of code I'm supposed to write?'"".

Townsend said the apprenticeship pipeline is a boon for the region's technology community.

""I can compete against other companies all day long and recruit people away, but it's not a net win for the city. This is a pathway that didn't exist a few years ago that actually generates net new talent that otherwise is in a job they're not satisfied with, but they feel trapped because they didn't have that four-year degree.""

In Braga, Portugal, web development and design vendor Subvisual has also committed to bringing new blood into the community by bootstrapping a small apprenticeship program on its own.

""People are complaining about colleges here in Portugal, but also around the world, that they are not close enough to the industry,"" Subvisual CEO Roberto Machado said.

""I always thought it was also the industry's responsibility to apply some change to do something about that. So we thought apprenticeship could be a good way for people who didn't have a college degree to enter the industry without a lot of experience.""

Machado said the 12-person shop has run eight apprentices through its program, which runs about two months, since its inception in 2014.

Two are still at Subvisual, while the other six have moved to other companies.

Machado said the apprentices are paid enough of a salary during their training to pay rent and basic expenses.

Though Subvisual receives no funding for its program, Machado said he thinks of it as a sort of marketing vector.

""We simply think that if that person in the end goes to a different company, that person will take us with them. They will learn how we work, they will talk about us. If we have to find reasons to justify the money we're spending, it's more on the marketing side and making sure the people who do our apprenticeships have a good experience here.""

Machado also said Subvisual is in the process of establishing an office in the U.S., in Boston, MA, and intends to bring its apprenticeship program there-people with drive and aptitude need jobs, and the industry needs them, he said.

""A lot of people need to change their career, because jobs will not return to some industries. More and more we need people from different areas to bring their knowledge, mix it with computer science and do different things. That's where the real innovation is happening right now. I hope the new attention apprenticeships are getting will help people shift to the industry, fill the gaps that exist, and also have better lives, because that's what matters in the end."""

But don?t expect a string of numbers.  Apprenticeship is so deeply rooted in both countries, and has been around for so long, that the question of who pays what has been long settled: the costs are shared between employers and the government, with employers paying apprentice wages and contributing to federal and local bodies responsible for developing curricula and assuring quality, while taxpayers foot the bill for the vocational schools that apprentices attend as part of their classroom training.

But for countries that do not have such large and mature systems, expanding apprenticeship inevitably bumps up against the question of who pays for what exactly. And one of the first questions you are likely to hear from any American CEO or HR officer you ask about apprenticeship is ?what?s the ROI on that?? We know that quality apprenticeship pays off, but some businesses understandably fret about overpaying their share - and more importantly about free-riding competitors - in the process the process of scaling up the national system."

1653,Barney Blakeney,5/10/2017  4:03 PM,"Trident Technical College now is accepting applications for the Charleston Regional Youth Apprenticeship Program. Melissa Stowasser, dean of TTC?s School and Community Initiatives Programs, said the four-year-old program that serves high school juniors, seniors and graduating seniors, is changing the way education looks in our region.  The program has grown exponentially, she says. In 2014 it began with 13 apprentices. In 2016-17, it?s got 76 apprentices. About 157 positions will be available in the upcoming year. Some 90 positions have been filled, but recruiting will continue until all the positions are filled, she said. About 45 percent of participants are African American.

Started in 2013 when a German manufacturing company approached TTC officials with an idea to train a workforce. The collaborative partnership has expanded to include 122 industrial partners, representing 16 occupations ranging from information technology to culinary arts in addition to the four regional school districts. The word?s gotten out and both the industrial and educational communities are embracing it, Stowwasser said.  It?s not hard to understand why. The program?s industrial partners realize the advantage of training their workforce. The two-year duration of the training program develops skilled workers who gain experience on the job before they are hired permanently. Participants get the opportunity to learn skills, earn wages and ultimately a certificate that can be applied toward an associate degree at Trident Tech."

Dan Lipinski (IL-3) and Rodney Davis (IL-13) visited with apprentices from Aon in Chicago and announced their bipartisan bill to reinvigorate America's apprenticeship programs. They recently reintroduced the Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs (LEAP) Act (H.R. 2399), which uses tax incentives to encourage more companies to offer apprenticeship programs.

""Apprenticeships provide highly valuable opportunities to combine learning in the classroom with learning on the job while earning a paycheck,"" stated Rep. Lipinski. ""If we can get more people into apprenticeships, we can make a great difference in their lives while also helping businesses find the skilled employees they need. I am very impressed with Aon's apprenticeship program and their apprentices, and the LEAP Act will help more businesses follow their lead."""

Fourteen high school seniors ? 13 in welding, one for manufacturing engineering ? have spent the last two years getting paid for skills training and taking classes part-time at Central Carolina Community College. The graduates also worked last summer full-time for Caterpillar. Caterpillar officials say the qualifications they earn through the training will allow them to get entry-level jobs that earn 30 percent more than normal entry level employment at the company."
1664,Stephen Huba,5/14/2017 11:00 PM," On 230 rolling acres near New Alexandria, mighty pieces of machinery roam the earth like large yellow dinosaurs.  The fleet of 75 vehicles ? bulldozers, graders, backhoes, cranes, rollers, excavators ? is there for the training of a growing cohort of apprentices, many of whom are anticipating a boom in construction partly tied to the region's oil and gas industry.  ?There's the need for qualified operators,? said Dennis Manown, a 27-year operator of heavy equipment. ?It's a good time to be in construction ? not just operating engineers but all the crafts and trades.?

Manown is training site coordinator at the Western Pennsylvania Operating Engineers Joint Apprenticeship and Training Program, a Salem Township school funded by labor and management since 1971. A gleaming $8 million building, opened in 2013, and a recent increase in enrollment from 200 to 300 apprentices attest to the fact that construction activity, partly spurred by Western Pennsylvania's energy industry, is on the rise, officials say.  ?All the journeymen and apprentices come to that little corner of Westmoreland County to do the training,? Steven Columbus, the program's administrative manager, recently told a group of energy industry leaders at Westmoreland County Community College. "
1665,Staff,5/14/2017 12:42 AM,"Its executives are among the throng of Southeast Michigan employers lamenting the skills gap that threatens productivity, growth and the economy at large.

The family-owned metal fastener and engineer services supplier in Livonia ended its apprenticeship programs years ago and has no immediate plans to launch another.

The state offsets the costs with significant grants per apprentice.

For every dollar spent on an apprenticeship program, an employer gains $1.47 on average in productivity increases, according to a recent Georgetown University study.

All the supplements mustered can't revive a practice that's been gutted of its lifeblood - workers who want in and will complete the programs.

""We keep getting approached and that the state can offset the costs, but our current employees have no interest in learning or going back to school..."".

The state is trying to boost learn-while-you-work programs, which are up to 999 registered programs this year from 782 in 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

Registered apprentice programs are still down more than 50 percent since 2005 after taking a huge hit during the Great Recession.

Marcia Black-Watson, administrative director for industry engagement at the state's Talent Investment Agency, said employers have reached a tipping point where building their own workforce is critical.

""Because the labor market is so tight, because we have the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in years, it's become difficult to find talent in skilled occupations,"" Black-Watson said.

""Employers now are really considering investment to grow their own talent, and apprenticeships are one of those.""

Gov. Rick Snyder initiated the Skilled Trades Training Fund in 2013, which provides $1,500 per apprentice for classroom training, $1,500 per apprentice for wage reimbursement and allocates an additional $3,000 per new apprentice from the labor department.

Professional trades will account for more than 500,000 jobs in Michigan's economy by 2024, accounting for 16 percent of all job growth during that period, according to the state.

Skilled trades are also projected to grow 50 percent faster than the statewide average during that time and offer a median wage 45 percent higher than the median for all occupations in the state.

In 2015, a new apprentice made an average of $14.51 per hour and an apprentice graduate earned $25.21 per hour.

Higher-paying, more stable jobs equal more tax revenue and less reliance on social safety nets.

Director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and Workforce in Washington, D.C., said U.S. employers still struggle to rationalize the expense of apprenticeship programs, even though there is a clear return on investment.

An apprenticeship can cost an employer from $25,000 to $250,000, according to data gathered by Carnevale.

""The U.S. does not have a tradition of employers being willing to pay to have people in the workplace only three days a week at their own cost,"" Carnevale said.

""We know that apprenticeships work, they provide higher earnings and productivity, but no one wants it.""

Despite increasing numbers joining apprenticeships, fewer have the skills they need to complete programs, Carnevale said.

Between 2008 and 2015, the number of newly registered apprentices in Michigan grew 69 percent from 3,132 to 5,305, according to a November report by the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget.

Apprentices completing programs dropped to 765 in 2014 from 1,275 in 2012, largely due to shrinking enrollments after the Great Recession.

Apprenticeships typically take one to four years to complete.

Experts say Michigan's strong economy may actually harm enrollments.

Michigan's unemployment rate remains low at 5.1 percent in March, down from 5.3 percent in February.

""Apprentices who find higher-paying work are likely to drop out of their apprenticeship program,"" said Wallace Hopp, associate dean for learning design and professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

""And as the more qualified people find regular jobs, the apprenticeship programs are forced to dig deeper into the pool and hence wind up getting more people with problems - drug use, family issues or just a lack of motivation - that will make them less likely to see the program through to completion.""

Local 58, which operates its own apprenticeship school in Warren funded by its members, uses a strict entrance exam to weed out potential dropouts.

The local recently began a 10-week pre-apprenticeship program to help get candidates up to speed on the requirements before enrolling in the regular program.

Roughly 87 percent of its apprentices complete the program.

IBEW currently has 600 in its apprenticeship program, down from a peak of 725.

Richard said the program hopes to reach 725 this year, but will not commit to more even if there's increased demand.

""We're feast or famine. I can't put people in the program only for them to be two years in and have the rug pulled out. That'd be a tragedy.""

The fix, Lawrence said, is on the supply side of the workforce-education equation: getting young people, educators, and their parents interested in the skilled trades.

""We need to get to young people in middle school or before; that's when young people are engaged on whether their future includes education or not,"" Lawrence said.

The state is beginning to make headway on this front.

The campaign started last year with billboards; the second phase will now focus on educating parents and students on career choices beyond a four-year degree.

Carnevale said engaging students in vocational training is now more critical than ever - because civil unrest begins with employment stagnation.

""We've never had that 'come to Jesus' moment in America. But it's here now. Apprenticeships are the world gold standard for creating jobs. Let's hope our governments listen."""

Apprenticeships are a commonly used workforce training model that combines on-the-job experience with classroom instruction. Registered apprenticeship programs are those that have been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship and/or with the state's apprenticeship agency.

1683,Thad Moore,5/18/2017  4:00 PM,"South Carolina's expanding apprenticeship initiative cracked a goal this week that it set a decade ago, when hardly anyone in the state signed up for on-the-job training programs.  Apprenticeship Carolina says more than 26,000 people have now enrolled in its programs since the initiative was set up in 2007, when fewer than 800 were signed up. When it was established, its original ambition was to hit 20,000 by 2020.

The new figures highlight the rapid growth of on-the-job training programs in South Carolina over the past decade in a state that historically had few apprenticeships, which have long been associated with labor unions.  At last count, the U.S. Department of Labor says, nearly 5,300 people were actively apprenticing in South Carolina last year. That?s an increase of nearly two-thirds in the last five years.

The declaration, and a new campaign of tweets on the subject, represent the first indication since Acosta's swearing-in three weeks ago that apprenticeships are at the core of the Trump administration's plans to train a new generation of workers.

The discussion of apprenticeships is a relatively new one for Trump, who campaigned for the White House on promises to restore manufacturing jobs that he said had been lost to flawed trade deals and unfair competition from China, Mexico and more.

It's not new to policymakers of either party or the private sector, whose leaders have for years run apprenticeship programs.

Some are modeled on those in such countries as Germany and the United Kingdom.

In a discussion in February, some of the two dozen CEOs gathered to discuss manufacturing jobs suggested there were still plenty of openings but too few qualified people to fill them.

One executive said his company has 50 participants in a factory apprenticeship program, but could take 500 if enough were qualified.

Unemployment is historically low, but there are gaps in some sectors.

Government figures show there are 324,000 open factory jobs nationwide - triple the number in 2009, during the depths of the recession.

At a White House round table discussion, some executives challenged Trump to generate a ""Moonshot"" of 5 million new apprenticeships over five years.

""Our companies are some of the greatest universities in the world. We shape these employees, we train them, we educate them, we bring them in,"" said Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who issued the challenge to Trump.

""Let's do that, let's go for that 5 million,"" Trump replied at the event in March.

There's also evidence of rare bipartisan agreement, at least on the value of apprenticeships, which generally combine state and federal government money with support from universities and companies looking to train people for specific jobs.

In some cases, students split their time between school and work, and the companies pay some portion of wages and tuition.

The budget compromise funding the federal government through September passed this month with $95 million for apprenticeship grants, an increase of $5 million - in part to increase the number of women apprentices.

1693,Associated Press,5/19/2017 11:10 AM,"U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Friday made public-private apprenticeships his debut issue as President Trump's point man on matching American workers with specific jobs.

?CEO after CEO has told me that they are eager to fill their vacancies, but they cannot find workers with the right skills,? Acosta told the labor ministers of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations gathered this week in Germany. Apprenticeships that pay salaries and often lead to careers, he added, ?are a major priority for President Trump and the Department of Labor.?

The declaration, and a new campaign of tweets on the subject, represent the first indication since Acosta's swearing-in three weeks ago that apprenticeships are at the core of the Trump administration's plans to train a new generation of workers.

The discussion of apprenticeships is a relatively new one for Trump, who campaigned for the White House on promises to restore manufacturing jobs that he said had been lost to flawed trade deals and unfair competition from China, Mexico and more. (Trump?s reality-TV franchise ?The Apprentice? is not about this kind of apprentice program.)

But the idea is not new to policymakers of either party or to the private sector, whose leaders have for years run apprenticeship programs. Some are modeled on those in such places as Germany and Britain.

In a discussion in February, some of the two dozen chief executives gathered to discuss manufacturing jobs suggested there were still plenty of openings but too few qualified people to fill them. One executive said his company has 50 participants in a factory apprenticeship program but could take 500 if enough were qualified.

Unemployment is historically low, but there are gaps in some sectors. Government figures show there are 324,000 open factory jobs nationwide ? triple the number there were in 2009, during the depths of the recession.

At a White House round table discussion, some executives challenged Trump to generate a ?moonshot? of 5 million new apprenticeships over five years.

?Our companies are some of the greatest universities in the world. We shape these employees, we train them, we educate them, we bring them in,? said Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who issued the challenge to Trump.

?Let's do that, let's go for that 5 million,? Trump replied at the event in March.

There's also evidence of rare bipartisan agreement, at least on the value of apprenticeships, which generally combine state and federal government money with support from universities and companies looking to train people for specific jobs. In some cases, students split their time between school and work, and the companies pay some portion of wages and tuition.

The budget compromise funding the federal government through September passed this month with $95 million for apprenticeship grants, an increase of $5 million ? in part to increase the number of female apprentices.

?POTUS & I are focused on boosting the number of women who participate in apprenticeship programs,? Acosta tweeted Thursday from Germany. While there, Acosta toured the BMW assembly plant in Munich. The company has an apprenticeship program in Spartanburg, S.C., with three community colleges in the area.

We have made a strong commitment to increasing the number of quality apprenticeships, including expansion into high-growth, emerging sectors where apprenticeships have historically been rare,"" Acosta said in a speech at the G-20 Labor and Employment Ministers' Meeting in Germany.

1710,Valerie Bolden-Barrett,5/22/2017 3:09 PM,"
    U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta continues to show that apprenticeship programs are at the center of President Donald Trump's jobs goals, according to various media reports.
    Acosta told labor ministers of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations in Germany that employers want to fill positions but can't find enough skilled workers. Company heads met at the White House in February discuss the lack of workers to fill manufacturing jobs, says the LA Times. 
    Currently, there are 324,000 unfilled U.S. factory jobs, which is three times the number in 2009. 


Apprenticeship programs aren't new to employers or lawmakers, all of whom have sponsored them.  Apprenticeships offer workers invaluable on-the-job training that can help close the skills gap confronting so many employers.

South Carolina has an apprenticeship program the U.S. Labor Department hails as successful. Apprenticeship Carolina has more than 26,000 people enrolled in the program since 2007, when it was first set up. Back then, fewer than 800 people had signed up. Today, the program has surpassed its goal of enrolling 20,000 people by 2020. Employers in other states might look to South Carolina as a prototype for their own programs ? and as an example of the growing demand of such programs.

?The president has proposed a 21% cut in the Labor Department's budget, though largely aimed at other jobs programs. Regardless, momentum in the space will only continue to increase, especially as the cost of four-year college skyrockets."
1716,Andrea Gord,5/24/2017 9:50 AM,"A dozen Darth Vaders cluster around a metal table in Humber College's trade and technology centre.

They watch as another masked member of the group presses the trigger of a welding gun, sending a dazzling spray of sparks in every direction.

Less than a minute later when the smoke clears and all the auto-darkening helmets come off, everyone is back to being high school girls in ponytails and earrings.

""I was curious to know how it works, and it's cool,"" says Lara Salvador, a Grade 10 student at Loretto College School in Toronto, still looking a little agog after her first welding experience.

""But holding it still was hard, and your arm gets tired.""

Lara likes science and learning new things, so she jumped at the chance to be first in line at the workshop, which was one of 12 offered during a special day-long event at Humber attended by 300 girls from Toronto Catholic high schools.

The fourth annual Women Entering Non-Traditional Trades conference was aimed at opening their eyes to the possibilities of careers in the skilled trades.

Before visiting the welding lab, Lara learned how to cut copper pipe and glue the joints together at the plumbing workshop.

Elsewhere on campus, teenaged girls were hammering and sanding their own wooden toolboxes in the home construction centre, learning basic wiring techniques in the electricians' shop, and getting hands-on experience in heating and air, auto mechanics and cooking in an industrial kitchen.

The event for Toronto Catholic District School Board girls is funded by the province as part of its commitment to promote skilled trades.

It's held in partnership with the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program, which offers apprenticeships to Grade 11 and 12 students through their school co-op programs, giving them the opportunity to work towards certification in a skilled trade while earning a high school diploma.

""We want to make sure when they come in they engage in hands-on activities, and that they're not just listening, they're doing,"" says Luciano Di Loreto, the apprenticeship project leader with the board.

As a result of growing demand, this year the board added a second day for Grade 7 girls, with 300 attending workshops last month at Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School.

The Toronto District School Board also runs a trades summit for girls.

High youth unemployment and a shortage of workers trained in the skilled trades have prompted the province, industry associations and schools to turn more attention to promoting those fields to young women, especially the ""Non-traditional"" ones for girls, such as plumbing and welding.

When it comes to young women entering the field, Di Loreto says change does not come easily.

""We are getting more interest each and every year but it's a very slow process,"" he says.

Roughly one in 10 apprenticeships go to women, and fewer in trades like welding, where women make up only 7 per cent of new registrants, electrical and carpentry.

That's despite the fact that many girls become quickly engaged once they get exposed through school, and often score higher than their male counterparts when they enrol in apprenticeship programs.

He's not the only one in the building who claims women have the dexterity and eye for detail found in the best tradespeople, especially when it comes to cabinet-making, electrical and automotive trades.

Changing attitudes is difficult, particularly among parents, he adds.

""I wish we'd had something like this when I was younger,"" Humber welding student Shannon Blake said as she watched the high school girls arrive for their session.

At 33, she recently discovered her passion for welding by accident after years of working at office jobs and realizing she'd rather do something hands-on.

""I like to feel that reward at the end of the day when I can see my work,"" says Blake, who is the only female in her class of 13.

""People think it's rough and you need to be strong, but really it's just a skill,"" she adds, flashing her perfectly manicured pink fingernails.

Attracting more females would change workplace cultures, and provide women with new career opportunities they may not have considered or which were previously not seen as serious options for women.

""It's like opening a new door,"" said student Sophia Siciliano, over the banging of hammers in Humber's home construction workshop, where the scent of lumber hangs in the air.

The Grade 11 student at Loretto College says her teachers encouraged girls to attend the event as a learning opportunity.

Around her, girls in safety goggles were pounding nails into pieces of wood to build toolboxes.

""Bring your elbow in closer,"" Jarek Wawrow, home renovation program co-ordinator, reminds one girl struggling to keep the nail going in straight.

It's all about using the science of levers to let the tool do the work, he says.

""Don't choke up on the hammer.""

At another table it's clear that Angelica Nerizon, 16, knows her way around a toolbox.

Her dad's an electrician and she sometimes gives him a hand.

The Grade 11 student at Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School still wanted to come and get a glimpse of the other hands-on careers she might consider down the road.For high school teacher Nicole Ross, the day was a chance for girls ""To get their hands dirty"" but also realize how much science, math, artistry and creativity is part of the skilled trades.

Ross, who graduated from university with a degree in chemistry, stumbled upon carpentry through an odd job on a construction site while travelling in New Zealand.

Instead of pursuing post-graduate studies, she set out to become a qualified carpenter and now teaches construction at Bishop Allen Academy.

Knowing how to create and fix things builds confidence, she says.

Exposing more girls to those skills and the career options that come with them is more important than ever, adds Ross, 32, who is now renovating her own house and has a sister who works as a scaffolder on Toronto highrises.

""Don't be afraid to try,"" she told the 300 girls in her opening address."

The state has invested $15 million per year for the last three years through the California Apprenticeship Initiative to create new apprenticeship programs in various industries. The initiative also funds pre-apprenticeship programs that prepare job seekers for registered apprenticeships. According to the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, state-supported apprenticeships make more jobs available for young people out of high school.  Five million dollars per year for the next five years will go into expanding pre-apprenticeship training programs under the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, which drives repairs to state roads, freeways, bridges and public transportation. The state said the act will support underrepresented populations, including at-risk youth, women, veterans and formerly incarcerated individuals.

California is not the only state starting or enhancing its apprentice programming. New Jersey allocated $10 million to create its Apprenticeship Network beginning in 2019. The state announced the program at the opening of a carpentry training center, with a focus on skilled construction workers.  Meanwhile, Home Depot and Lowe's have committed millions of dollars to training and apprenticeship programs. In February, Lowe?s announced its Track to the Trades initiative, a pre-apprenticeship program for its employees. Part-time and full-time employees are eligible for the program, which takes six to 10 months to complete.

1735,PR Web,5/31/2017 8:40 AM,"""Employers, educators and workforce development communities need the ability to execute and build a sustainable apprenticeship model that will unlock the potential in our talent pool, yet doing this remains a significant challenge in the U.S."".

Franklin Apprenticeships, a U.S. based consulting and capacity building firm dedicated solely to delivering on the promise for U.S. expansion of Apprenticeship Programs, announced today the official launch of its company.

Aiming to modernize apprenticeship programs in the U.S. by invigorating practical, real-life workforce training and development, Franklin Apprenticeships will bridge the widening skills gap between young adults, employers and workforce development communities that need to attract, employ and retain young professionals.

""Employers, educators and workforce development communities need the ability to execute and build a sustainable apprenticeship model that will unlock the potential in our talent pool, yet doing this remains a significant challenge in the U.S.,"" said Kimberly Nichols, CEO and Co- Founder at Franklin Apprenticeships.

""That's why we are excited to expand U.S. apprenticeship programs with the launch of our company - where we are leveraging best practices from the U.K. and other countries that have built successful apprenticeship programs.""

Franklin Apprenticeships first announced its plans last November at the Transatlantic Apprenticeship Exchange Forum that was held at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., and has already been engaged by signature U.S.-based blue chip companies to establish aggressive apprenticeship program plans beginning in 2017.

""We believe apprenticeships will be a significant solution to the IT industry's workforce challenges,"" said Charles Eaton, EVP, Social Innovation at CompTIA. ""Apprenticeships also provide a meaningful and scalable vehicle to create greater economic mobility and bring under-represented populations into our industry, which is important to CompTIA. Franklin Apprenticeships' solution of modernizing American apprenticeships to regain America's competitive edge and their experience and expertise in developing and delivering successful apprenticeship programs makes them the perfect partner with which to explore the opportunities of tech apprenticeships.""

The talent gap is a national crisis that threatens America's competitive edge.

Applying the age-old practice of apprenticeships can serve to renew the purpose of America's higher education and training systems-systems that have become dated and leave American youth saddled with debt, and deficient in the critical skills necessary for today's emerging economy.

Expanding the U.S. apprenticeship program in existing industries, as well as developing programs in non-traditional industries such as IT, Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing, and Professional Services, can help fill this gap.

MAXIMUS, a leading operator of government workforce programs in five countries, is serving as a strategic advisor to Franklin Apprenticeships.

Michael Bolton, Vice President of Human Services at MAXIMUS, commented, ""Apprenticeships are a great opportunity for career seekers, particularly disadvantaged job seekers or youth just starting out. They do not provide simply a map of the employment pathway, but rather a well-built, well-lit roadway to a sustainable career. We are excited to be combining our experience in workforce development with Franklin Apprenticeships' track record of introducing the apprenticeship model to support non-traditional fields. The result is a solution that provides employers and job seekers with the advantages of apprenticeships in every sector of the U.S. economy.""

About Franklin Apprenticeships Franklin Apprenticeships is igniting a movement.

We offer the strategy, tools, and support network to help shape a re-imagined Apprenticeship system.

Working in partnership with Businesses, Educators, Families, and Economic and Workforce Development Agencies, Franklin Apprenticeships is the first US-based firm dedicated solely to delivering on the promise for expansion of Apprenticeship Programs."
1739,Nicholas Wyman,5/5/2017 12:15 PM,"When a room full of passionate apprenticeship advocates met in Washington yesterday for the first day of the Apprenticeship Forward conference, the mood was understandably upbeat and optimistic.  Why? Because calls for the U.S. to expand apprenticeship programs seem to be gaining more traction daily. And overnight the news had come through that Congress? omnibus budget compromise would again expand funding for apprenticeships, to $95 million over the next year.

Now more than ever, Americans need educational options and career pathways which are cost effective and oriented to delivering skilled careers and stable employment. That common ground was found to expand appropriations in the budget bill, is a strong signal that interest in apprenticeships is not expendable.  This column recently threw its support behind an audacious plan for the Trump Administration to adopt a nation wide target to hire five million apprenticeships in five years. Since then, a range of influential people and organisations, from Ivanka Trump to the Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, Company CEO?s including Sales Force Mark Benioff to the National Skills Coalition, have come forth to endorse this proposal."
1740,Business Wire,5/5/2017 9:05 AM,"As an industry leader in the apprenticeship space, with over 40 years of successful apprenticeship programs across Europe, it has been Dow's intent to obtain the U.S. Department of Labor registration for its U.S. program.

""We are honored to receive this U.S. Department of Labor recognition, further evidence that our Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program is successfully advancing Dow's vision of increasing the availability of highly skilled technical workers to support business growth and advance skill development in manufacturing and engineering,"" said Andrew Liveris, chairman, and chief executive officer of Dow, who was appointed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump to lead the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which has the goal of increasing the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.

""With Dow's vast experience and leadership in workforce training we're sharing these ideas with the Trump Administration and demonstrating the opportunity we have to scale national programs to create a 21st century workforce. This focus on workforce training is essential to creating a growing and vibrant U.S. manufacturing sector.""

Launched in 2015, the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program offers a pathway to manufacturing careers through both formal education and on-the job training.

This program is among a portfolio of apprenticeship programs within Dow which support STEM education and Dow's STEM career pathways.

The program has already grown to just under 100 apprentices at seven sites across four states - Michigan, California, Texas, and Louisiana - with projections of reaching 130 by the end of 2017 with continued expansion expected.

The journey to today's implementation of the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship program began in 2013 with the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership 2.0 Steering Team.

Dow's Liveris co-chaired this team along with Rafael Reif, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Within one year, the team produced the Employer's Playbook for Building an Apprenticeship Program, co-authored by Dow, Alcoa and Siemens.

This same year, Dow piloted the U.S. Apprenticeship program, with the first wave of apprentices hired in 2015.

Dow began to participate in ApprenticeshipUSA activities.

ApprenticeshipUSA is a Department of Labor initiative focused on doubling the number of registered apprenticeship programs by 2019.

""Apprenticeship programs provide an opportunity for the public and private sectors to partner in a meaningful way and to prepare the next generation of Americans for tomorrow's high-skilled, high-paying advanced manufacturing careers. Through the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program, we are building our workforce of tomorrow and strengthening our global competitiveness,"" said Johanna Soderstrom, chief Human Resource officer, corporate vice president Human Resources and Aviation.

In order for the country to meet its workforce needs and to help U.S. companies maintain a competitive advantage in the global economy, the U.S. Department of Labor is committed to expanding the availability of apprenticeships to more businesses and workers across the country.

By achieving this milestone, Dow is recognized as having met all of the requirements of an apprenticeship program.

All apprentices that complete the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship program will now receive a Certification of Completion from the U.S. Department of Labor.

""Apprenticeships are a tried and true workforce development strategy,"" said Liveris.

""Employers that utilize apprentices report higher productivity, higher retention rates and a substantial return on investment. The program supports Dow's growth in the U.S. by building a talent pipeline in difficult-to fill technical roles.""

Through partnerships between Dow, local community colleges and veterans groups, the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program is targeted towards people interested in pursuing a career as an instrument electrical technician, process technician or millwright.

Apprentices experience three or more years of world-class training and on-the-job experience.

During this time they have their tuition funded by Dow and receive a competitive salary that increases incrementally over their tenure in the program.

Apprentices who successfully complete the program obtain an associate's degree in process technology, instrument technology, or industrial maintenance and will be evaluated for employment opportunities at Dow.

The program also builds Dow's reputation on a national level as a thought leader on U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, STEM skills development and job creation - making the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program good for Dow, the apprentices, and the economy.

Dow combines the power of science and technology to passionately innovate what is essential to human progress.

The Company is driving innovations that extract value from material, polymer, chemical and biological science to help address many of the world's most challenging problems, such as the need for fresh food, safer and more sustainable transportation, clean water, energy efficiency, more durable infrastructure, and increasing agricultural productivity.

Dow's integrated, market-driven portfolio delivers a broad range of technology-based products and solutions to customers in 175 countries and in high-growth sectors such as packaging, infrastructure, transportation, consumer care, electronics, and agriculture.

In 2016, Dow had annual sales of $48 billion and employed approximately 56,000 people worldwide.

1748,Staff,5/8/2017 11:43 AM,"Dow Chemical has a long history of using apprenticeship programs.

For over 40 years the company has used this programs across Europe.

While it has around 100 programs in the U.S., the company desired to obtain the U.S. Department of Labor registration for its U.S. program.

Last week the company got its wish when the Department of Labor formally recognized company's U.S. Apprenticeship Program as having been approved National Standards of Apprenticeship.

By achieving this milestone, Dow is recognized as having met all of the requirements of an apprenticeship program.

All apprentices that complete the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship program will now receive a Certification of Completion from the U.S. Department of Labor.

""We are honored to receive this U.S. Department of Labor recognition, further evidence that our Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program is successfully advancing Dow's vision of increasing the availability of highly skilled technical workers to support business growth and advance skill development in manufacturing and engineering,"" said Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow, who was appointed by U.S. President Trump to lead the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which has the goal of increasing the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.

""With Dow's vast experience and leadership in workforce training we're sharing these ideas with the Trump Administration and demonstrating the opportunity we have to scale national programs to create a 21st century workforce,' said Liveris.""This focus on workforce training is essential to creating a growing and vibrant U.S. manufacturing sector.

Launched in 2015, the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program offers a pathway to manufacturing careers through both formal education and on-the job training.

This program is among a portfolio of apprenticeship programs within Dow which support STEM education and Dow's STEM career pathways.

The program has already grown to just under 100 apprentices at seven sites across four states - Michigan, California, Texas, and Louisiana - with projections of reaching 130 by the end of 2017 with continued expansion expected.

""Apprenticeships are a tried and true workforce development strategy,"" said Liveris.

""Employers that utilize apprentices report higher productivity, higher retention rates and a substantial return on investment.

The program supports Dow's growth in the U.S. by building a talent pipeline in difficult-to fill technical roles.

Through partnerships between Dow, local community colleges and veterans groups, the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program is targeted towards people interested in pursuing a career as an instrument electrical technician, process technician or millwright.

Apprentices experience three or more years of world-class training and on-the-job experience.

During this time they have their tuition funded by Dow and receive a competitive salary that increases incrementally over their tenure in the program.

Apprentices who successfully complete the program obtain an associate's degree in process technology, instrument technology, or industrial maintenance and will be evaluated for employment opportunities at Dow.

The program also builds Dow's reputation on a national level as a thought leader on U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, STEM skills development and job creation - making the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship Program good for Dow, the apprentices, and the economy.

The journey to today's implementation of the Dow U.S. Apprenticeship program began in 2013 with the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership 2.0 Steering Team.

Dow's Liveris co-chaired this team along with Rafael Reif, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Within one year, the team produced the Employer's Playbook for Building an Apprenticeship Prgrogram co-authored by Dow, Alcoa and Siemens.

This same year, Dow piloted the U.S. Apprenticeship program, with the first wave of apprentices hired in 2015.

Dow began to participate in ApprenticeshipUSA activities.

The program is a Department of Labor initiative focused on doubling the number of registered apprenticeship programs by 2019.

""Apprenticeship programs provide an opportunity for the public and private sectors to partner in a meaningful way and to prepare the next generation of Americans for tomorrow's high-skilled, high-paying advanced manufacturing careers,"" said Johanna Soderstrom, chief human Resource officer, corporate vice president human resources and Aviation, Dow Chemical."
1753,Alex Contarino,5/9/2017  11:37 AM,"Recently, a bill was introduced in the North Carolina legislature that would shift control of the state's apprenticeship program from the department of commerce to the community college system. The goal is to streamline the program and make it more aligned with some of the community colleges' workforce development initiatives.  The program, ""ApprenticeshipNC,"" has been receiving more attention lately, as lawmakers pivot to vocational training programs as a way to boost the education and earning potential of recent high school graduates. The program helps to provide students more postsecondary options and gives them an effective, low-cost alternative to the traditional college pathway.

A vast improvement to the previous ""college for all"" approach, offering a variety of programs means students can more easily match their education to their aptitudes and interests. In the long run that will help more students learn marketable skills and find meaningful, stable careers.  NC's apprenticeship program is relatively straightforward. Students indicate their interest in the program and desired career path, and ApprenticeshipNC matches them with a suitable company. Together, along with a local community college, the student and company arrange a class and work schedule. The company generally covers the cost of schooling and pays the apprentice a wage. It lasts one to four years, depending on arrangements the apprentice and company decide. Apprentices can work to become, for instance, machinists and electricians, all while gaining experience with regional and even national companies."
1754,Tess Taylor,5/9/2017  12:00 PM,"Companies in Silicon Valley are creating opportunities for adults who come from non-tech backgrounds to enter careers in technology through special apprenticeship programs, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Candidates like Lyn Muldrow, a coder from Baltimore who is now working on her dream career as a result of LinkedIn's Reach apprenticeship program, which offers mentoring and training over a six month period. Pinterest also has an apprenticeship program designed to bring more diversity to the tech sector.  Currently, less than 5% of employees in Silicon Valley technology careers come from non-traditional backgrounds.  According to Course Report, a website that features coding camps, around 18,000 individuals graduated from the 91 active coding bootcamps and schools in the USA as of 2016. 

The demand for IT talent is still going strong. Companies that are trying to keep jobs on American soil have begun offering apprenticeship options for adults who have previously faced barriers to employment due to lack of computer science degrees. LinkedIn and Pinterest are just a couple of examples, but there are hundreds of private coding academies, boot camps, and workshops preparing people for work in technology. Women are also entering careers in technology in rapid order. According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology, 26% of the computing workforce jobs are occupied by women as of 2016. Apprenticeships can provide a fast-track for women who wish to become qualified in technology to build long-lasting careers. "
1756,Simone Alicea,5/9/2017  8:00 AM,"Apprenticeships are common in sectors like building and manufacturing, but now Washington state is trying to apply the model to the tech industry.  The first cohort of 41 apprentices were pinned by Governor Jay Inslee in a ceremony Friday honoring the state's only registered tech apprenticeship program called Apprenti.

The typical pathway for jobs in the tech industry tends to stem from four-year universities and coding schools. People complete those programs hoping to come out with the necessary skills to be recruited by companies like Microsoft and Amazon.  ""What we're really beginning to learn as an industry is we can't just recruit; we have to invest in the development of the workforce to have a sustainable growth in the future,"" said Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association, which runs the program.

1758,Sen. Amy Klobuchar Today At 1,5/9/2017 3:32 PM,"In Duluth, thanks to partnerships with local employers, 70 students are graduating Lake Superior College every year with the skills needed to fill high-wage, high-growth jobs around the region.

My staff and I have covered that and more with business leaders, educators and students from all across our state during discussions focused on local initiatives to prepare tomorrow's workers for the good jobs businesses are creating today.

We also heard about some of the challenges employers are confronting.

Representatives from regional workforce centers highlighted the trouble local businesses are having finding workers with the right skills for available jobs.

These companies aren't alone - last year's State of Manufacturing report revealed that 66 percent of Minnesota manufacturers had difficulty finding employees with the right skills for open jobs.

Registered apprenticeships help bridge that skills gap by matching workers' skills with those needed in high-demand jobs through a learn-and-earn approach.

Students receive a salary while completing on-the-job training tailored to the business' needs and certified by the Department of Labor.

That makes apprenticeships one of the most-cost effective workforce development tools in the country.

We need to double down on our efforts to expand these partnerships.

Two years ago, I pressed for $5 million in grant money from the Department of Labor to strengthen apprenticeships in Minnesota.

Businesses and educators have put the funds to good use.

At Bu00fchler, Inc., in Plymouth, students at Dunwoody College of Technology receive pay and benefits while they learn and work.

In Pequot Lakes, Dane Walter changed course early in his collegiate career to do an apprenticeship with Pequot Tool & Manufacturing.

Thanks to Pequot Tool's work with Central Lakes College, Dane - like the hundreds of Minnesotans who pursue apprenticeships - is well on his way to a successful career in the town where he grew up and where he wants to raise a family of his own.

Apprenticeships are a win-win-win: They align incentives for employers, educators and students.

We need to be doing more to support these partnerships.

Despite clear evidence of the benefits, apprenticeships are underutilized.

I am working with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to change that.

Our bipartisan bill, the American Apprenticeship Act, would provide funding to states to create or expand tuition assistance for participants in pre-apprenticeship and Registered Apprenticeship programs.

The legislation would also authorize the Department of Labor to award competitive grants to states that have developed successful strategies to promote these programs.

Investments in apprenticeships are investments in our future.

By 2018, it's estimated that 70 percent of all jobs will require postsecondary training.

Just 40 percent of Minnesota's workforce currently meets that standard.

With more and more Baby Boomers getting ready for retirement, the gap between trained workers and high-skill jobs will only grow.

By committing to strengthening our workforce, we're committing to keeping Minnesota's economy strong for years to come.

1760,Kathy Gurchiek Jun 1,6/1/2017 1:20 AM,"The Hartford welcomed 20 apprentices to its claims operations in May, with plans to bring 200 apprentices aboard by 2020.

The Connecticut-based property and casualty insurance company is the latest example of an organization offering on-the-job paid training and mentoring for white-collar positions.

Apprentices in the two-year program will become eligible for full-time positions assisting customers in the company's claims centers in Phoenix or Windsor, Conn., after completing 61 credit hours of college coursework and 2,400 hours of paid, on-the-job training.

John Kinney, the company's chief claims officer, noted in a news release that its partnerships with local community colleges for the program will help the firm ""Recruit skilled claims professionals outside of the traditional college track, and students will gain education, training and a full-time position at a company where they can grow their career.""

The concept of paid, on-the-job training traditionally has been the purview of manufacturers and trade organizations, but in recent years the U.S. has been looking to European models that ""Provide fast-tracked, on-the-job training in white-collar professions,"" according to The Hechinger Report.

The Report, which covers innovations in education, is a project of the Hechinger Institute on Education and the Media at the Columbia University Teachers College in New York City.

In July 2015, for example, the U.S. Department of Labor and Switzerland signed a Joint Declaration of Intent to exchange policy information and best practices in vocational education and training.

The DOL was interested in establishing an apprenticeship program based on the Swiss vocational education model.

DOL Secretary Alexander Acosta said in a news release that The Hartford is an example of companies that are ""Unlocking the potential of apprenticeship, especially those industries that have newly adopted it as a training model.""

Among those are Aon, a professional services company headquartered in London with offices in Chicago and Lincolnshire, Ill. Aon offers apprenticeships in human resources, technology and insurance.

Participants are considered full-time employees and receive a salary, benefits, paid tuition to pursue an associate degree from a school Aon is partnered with and a mentor.

Zurich North America, which has U.S. headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill., was the first insurance apprenticeship program of its kind in the U.S. It is modeled after the program at the company's Switzerland headquarters.

The U.S. program offers apprenticeships in underwriting and claims and includes weekly classes at a local college.

CVS Health piloted its apprenticeship program in Detroit in 2005.

It has since partnered with organizations across the country, such as the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services and Wisconsin's Bureau of Apprenticeship Standards.

It has placed more than 1,500 apprentices in retail pharmacy and management, according to the company.

Former President Barack Obama recognized its efforts during his 2015 State of the Union Address.

The federal government has certified apprenticeship programs for more than 75 years, according to the DOL, and there are more than 533,000 apprenticeships available in more than 1,000 occupations throughout the U.S. The Obama administration promoted apprenticeships as a way to bridge the so-called skills gap, and President Donald Trump is calling for the creation of 5 million apprenticeships within the next five years.

The Hartford is participating in the DOL's ApprenticeshipUSA program, which has a network of more than 150,000 employers and which the DOL describes as ""An employer-driven model that combines on-the-job learning with related classroom instruction."" As part of the program, the DOL provides tuition assistance through the American Apprenticeship Grant Initiative.

The Hartford is partnering with the Connecticut Department of Labor, the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Capital Community College in Hartford and Rio Salado College in metropolitan Phoenix to offer an insurance-specific curriculum.

Apprenticeship program expanding at Schaeffler Group USA Inc. Building on a 37-year history of offering apprenticeship programs in the U.S. that were recently recognized at the White House, Schaeffler Group USA's inaugural class of locally trained apprentices will receive Journeyman Tool & Die certifications - and a two-year job guarantee - at the company's regional headquarters in Fort Mill, S.C. FORT MILL, S.C., June 1, 2017.

PRNewswire/ - Global industrial and automotive supplier Schaeffler is once again expanding its award-winning manufacturing apprenticeship program in the United States.

Schaeffler is preparing to award journeyman tool & die certification to the first group of apprentices to complete the company's rigorous three-and-a-half-year training program at its Fort Mill, S.C., location.

Underscored the importance of apprenticeship programs to Schaeffler's long-term growth, ""Highly qualified employees are the most important pillar for the future success of Schaeffler in the U.S. Our awardwinning apprenticeship programs are among the most important training investments we can make in our workforce to ensure that success.""

""Schaeffler continues to invest in the people of South Carolina., and for that we are extremely grateful,"" said South Carolina.

""The development of a future workforce is critical to sustaining economic growth. With this expanded apprenticeship program, Schaeffler is showing its commitment to training South Carolinians for future jobs, and we're excited for the opportunities that this initiative will create for the people of our state.""

As a family-owned company, the Herzogenaurach, Germany.

Based manufacturer of bearings and precision components is committed to the continuing education of its employees.

Recognizing early on that the key to its manufacturing success in the U.S. is a well-trained workforce, Schaeffler has been offering apprenticeship programs in the United States.

In March of this year, the company's award-winning apprenticeship programs were highlighted at the White House when Schaeffler Group CEO Klaus Rosenfeld.

In a roundtable discussion on vocational training programs and continuing education in the United States.

In his remarks at the conclusion of the White House meeting, Mr. Rosenfeld reinforced the company's commitment to vocational training, ""As a global family business, providing our employees with vocational training and continuing education opportunities is a tradition that we have always held in the highest regard. We look forward to continuing this tradition, in particular with regard to the significant changes that our industry is facing and the need to combine mechanics, electronics and systems know-how. This is not only our social responsibility as an employer, but also our way to ensure long-term competitiveness.""

Apprenticeship curriculum builds upon the success of similar vocational training programs the company has offered in Wooster, Ohio., since 1980, and in Cheraw, S.C., since 1988.

These comprehensive three-and-ahalf-year programs are modeled after the German practice of combining on-the-job training with classes at a vocational school.

The success of these programs is evidenced by the more than 500 graduates now working at various Schaeffler sites.

Apprentice program is comprised of two main components: academic/shop theory taken at York Technical College.

In nearby Rock Hill, S.C., and on-the-job training at one of three manufacturing locations on Schaeffler's Fort Mill.

The three-anda-half-year program encompasses 7,000 hours of training divided between vocational and on-the-job learning environments.

Apprentices learn the trades of Skilled Setup Operator, Industrial Maintenance and Tool & Die Maker, enabling them to become an internal source for Schaeffler to fill key jobs involving new products and technologies.

Program, graduating apprentices receive an associate's degree in either Machine Tool Technology or Industrial Maintenance from York Technical College.

As well as an Apprenticeship Certificate/Journeyman's Card from the U.S. Department of Labor.

Graduating apprentices are given a guaranteed two-year job assignment with Schaeffler.

Top graduates are also encouraged to continue their studies toward an associate's degree or bachelor's degree in engineering, thereby enabling the company to bolster its engineering talent.

""The Schaeffler Group is a world leader not only in their market, but also in workforce development,"" said York Technical College.

""York Technical College. is proud to be Schaeffler's regional partner in support of apprenticeships and in providing employee development opportunities. Our respective organizations' combined efforts to create innovative pathways and partnerships for our students and Schaeffler's workforce needs have produced results that have been a tremendous benefit for all involved.""

Campus currently has 14 apprentices studying toward their associate's degree, while 11 others are completing their on-the-job training.

Three of the apprentices from the latter group are preparing to receive their Journeyman Tool & Die certification this summer.

In just the past ten years, Schaeffler has invested over $35 million.

In its U.S. apprenticeship programs at its facilities in South Carolina.

Ohio., during which time the company has graduated 216 apprentices.

Recently recognized the Schaeffler Group for having the state's largest registered manufacturing apprenticeship program: Schaeffler's Wooster.

Facility alone produces the most apprentices of all of the Buckeye State's manufacturing programs.

On a broader level, Schaeffler was named ""National Business of the Year"" in 2014 by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, after being nominated by the State of South Carolina.

Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the U.S. compared with European countries and have a proven record of good outcomes for workers, administration officials said. Nine in 10 Americans who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary is $60,000 a year, according to the Labor Department.

The administration is committed to ?supporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,? Ivanka Trump, the president?s daughter and assistant, said Friday. ?There has been great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.""

1772,Roberta Rampt,6/10/2017 6:55 PM,"WASHINGTON President Donald Trump, who became a reality television star with a show called ""The Apprentice,"" will spend a lot of time next week promoting a plan to expand apprenticeships to help companies find more skilled workers to fill jobs, the White House said.

It would be the second consecutive week in which the White House will make a push to show Trump is moving ahead on his top domestic priority - jobs - in spite of investigations into whether he had anything to do with possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has refuted those allegations, which have overshadowed his efforts to boost economic growth.

Last week was branded ""Infrastructure week"" with a series of events dealing with fixing the nation's decrepit roads and bridges, another plank in Trump's jobs platform.

A congressional hearing on the Russia imbroglio featuring James Comey - the FBI director Trump fired - sucked up all the attention in Washington.

Next week will be ""Workforce development week"" where the White House highlights plans to combat the skills gap.

U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April with government data showing employers struggling to find workers with the right skills.

Trump's plan has been in the works for months, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, adviser Reed Cordish, and Trump's secretaries of labor, education and commerce.

The White House was mum on the precise details of Trump's plan to expand apprenticeships ahead of his unveiling it in a speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

A real estate developer who is familiar with the use of.

Apprenticeship programs in the building trades, Trump has.

Praised Germany's apprenticeship system as a model.

Ivanka Trump discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House in March, and toured a Siemens.

Trump will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to visit a training program at Waukesha County Technical College with Republican Governor Scott Walker, a former rival in the race to become the 2016 Republican presidential candidate.

On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump will hold a roundtable on the issue with 15 CEOs at the White House.

The president will then meet with eight governors on Thursday to discuss the topic at the White House.

The White House declined to say which CEOs and governors would be there.

One thing that likely will not be in Trump's plan: a surge in spending.

The White House expects the private sector to take the lead. A senior White House official said the federal government had allocated $16.7 billion to 43 job training programs in 13 agencies in fiscal 2017.

""It's not a money question. There's a lot of money out there being thrown at this,"" the official said."

He starred on the reality TV shows ""The Apprentice"" and ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" But Trump also has long experience with apprenticeship programs in construction and other building trades from his years as a real estate developer, the White House said.

Now Trump wants to encourage more apprenticeship programs in other fields to help give American workers the skills they need to fill some of the 6 million job openings in the United States, according to administration officials.

The effort will be centered on encouraging workforce training partnerships between businesses and schools, and apparently will not include additional federal money.

""The reality is that there are still Americans seeking employment despite low unemployment rates and companies are struggling to fill vacancies that require various levels of skills and training,"" said Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and one of his advisors.

The administration will be launching ""a series of initiatives"" and will call on Congress ""To pass reforms expanding apprenticeships and raise awareness about the fact [that] there are important, very viable career paths outside of the traditional four-year college experience,"" she said.

Ivanka Trump and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta will join President Trump for three events next week on workforce development with a particular emphasis on apprenticeships - programs in which people learn skills from experienced workers while getting paid.

It will be the second straight week the White House tries to emphasize a theme - this week was infrastructure - in the face of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.

On Tuesday, the president, his daughter and Acosta will travel to Waukesha County Technical College in Pewaukee, Wis. Joined by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, they will tour classrooms, including one in which students are being trained to operate power generation equipment made by a local manufacturer, said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.

There also will be a roundtable discussion with teachers, apprentices and local business owners looking to fill skilled jobs.

Back in Washington on Wednesday, President Trump then will give a speech at the Labor Department outlining the administration's workforce development initiatives.

Ivanka Trump also will lead a roundtable discussion at the White House with about 15 chief executives on the topic.

On Thursday, eight governors will join President Trump, his daughter, Acosta and Vice President Mike Pence for another workforce development roundtable.

""This is an initiative that has our absolute highest level of attention and focus,"" Ivanka Trump told reporters Friday.

There were no details of Trump's plans, but they are unlikely to include additional federal spending.

The administration is reviewing and could shift the $16.7 billion spent on 43 job training programs spread across 13 agencies.

Trump's proposed 2018 budget would cut funding for adult, youth and dislocated worker training grants to states by 40%, to $1.6 billion, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

Administration officials touted apprenticeship programs by IBM and Dow Chemical Co. And President Trump has praised Germany's experience with apprenticeships.

""For decades, Germany has been a model for highly successful apprenticeship - that's a name I like, apprentice - apprenticeship programs,"" Trump said in March during a roundtable discussion that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held with business leaders.

""As a result, Germany's youth unemployment rate is much lower than many of the other countries, especially the EU countries,"" he said.

The Trump administration wants to help workers get the training they need to fill jobs in manufacturing, among other fields, Ivanka Trump said.

The 6 million job openings in April are the most since the 1980s, and many of them are in manufacturing, information technology and healthcare, Acosta said.

With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.3% last month, its lowest point since 2001, businesses complain they can't find workers with the skills needed to fill some jobs.

Less than 0.2% of workers have participated in apprenticeship programs.

90% of those who did, had a job waiting with an average salary of about $60,000 a year, Acosta said.

""Apprenticeship programs should not be limited to areas where they're widely used now, which is the building trades,"" he said.

""They can be used across a wide variety of sectors and industries."""
1776,Keith Lawrence Messenger-inquirer,6/11/2017 5:12 AM,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is trying to change the subject back to his promise to make American job creation a top priority.

""We want to get back to running our great country,"" Trump said at a White House news conference on Friday after a week that saw Washington and much of the country fixated on the damaging testimony of his fired FBI director.

Facing turmoil about investigations that began over his campaign's ties to Russia, Trump plans to devote next week to bringing more Americans into the economy by having them start working as apprentices.

The effort follows a week spent on infrastructure in which the president remained relatively vague about his policies in hopes of starting a conversation.

The jobs training initiative is aimed at millions of Americans who could consider apprenticeships instead of four-year college degrees, which can leave them struggling to pay off student loans.

As presented by White House aides Friday, the push so far lacks the details of a significant policy drive.

Trump's young presidency is facing an increasingly tense period, amid the congressional and Justice Department probes into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and ties to the Trump campaign.

Other items on the Trump agenda are also mired in uncertainty, including a tax overhaul and plans to replace the health insurance law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

To turn to jobs and apprenticeships in particular, Trump is visiting a technical college in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, delivering a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday and meeting with eight governors at the White House on Thursday.

There are few specifics as to how Trump would encourage more Americans to simultaneously work and learn as apprentices.

He intends to improve coordination on the issue among businesses, schools and government leaders.

""It's really when those elements come together that the country has seen the best results,"" Reed Cordish, a presidential aide on intragovernmental and technology issues, said in a conference call with reporters.

Administration officials declined to say how much additional money would be devoted for apprenticeship programs, let alone how they intend to increase the number of people taking part- from roughly 500,000 in fiscal 2016.

At a White House event earlier this year with CEOs, Trump said he was willing to try for a goal of 5 million new apprenticeships over five years.

Part of the challenge, White House officials said, was changing negative attitudes toward vocational education.

Trump's proposed budget would slash the Labor Department's budget by a fifth to $9.6 billion and its job training programs by more than a third.

The $90 million spent on apprenticeships would be spared.

The plan aims to more tightly organize what his aides say are 43 job training programs across 13 agencies.

Angela Hanks, of the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Trump budget betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how apprenticeship programs work.

""It's great if we can all agree that apprenticeships are good,"" she said.

""But if you can't access child care to get there, and you can't partner to develop good programs because the workforce system that we have has been gutted, it's hard to see how you get to the goal that the president's laid out.""

Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and an aide, said that worker training is necessary for her father to deliver on his promise to create 25 million jobs over a decade.

Many employers say they can't find workers with the necessary skills.

The number of job openings climbed above 6 million in April, an all-time high, but the level of hiring has barely risen over the past year.

Apprenticeships had largely been focused on the construction sector but have since branched out to include health care and information technology, among other fields, said Andrew Cortes, who leads a committee that advises the secretary of labor on the government's registered apprenticeship program.

The Obama-era Labor Department - which also encouraged apprenticeships - noted that 91 percent of those that completed the programs found jobs with average incomes above $60,000.

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Wednesday defended Trump's budget to a House committee considering its own plan.

""We're going to do more with less,"" he told members of the Appropriations Committee, describing the president's budget priorities as ""Smart investments in programs that work.""

""You can only do less with less,"" replied Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who criticized the cuts in jobs programs for Americans who need the most help finding work."
1791,Staff,6/12/2017 12:23 PM,"President Donald Trump is expected to expand apprenticeship programs as a focal point of his labor policy, aimed at filling a record level of open jobs and draw back Americans who have left the workforce.

The Wall Street Journal reported last weekend that the president will announce the initiative this week.

Apprenticeships are an underused form of workforce training in the United States, compared with European countries, the newspaper said.

Nine of 10 Americans who complete apprentice training land a job with a starting salary of $60,000 a year, according to the Labor Department.

The administration is committed to ""Supporting working families and creating a pathway for them to have robust and successful careers,"" Ivanka Trump said on Friday, according to the newspaper.

""There has been a great focus on four-year higher education, and in reality, that is not the right path for everyone.""

Boat manufacturers - largely based in the United States - and boat dealerships have struggled to fill service and manufacturing positions.

At the American Boating Congress in May, Pamela Lendzion, of the American Boat Builders and Repairers Association, met with an aide to Ivanka Trump to discuss the problem and urge apprenticeship programs - a conversation that was received very well, Lendzion said.

White House officials discussing the president's goal son Friday gave few details on program changes or requests to Congress, the Wall Street Journal said.

They said the president will offer more details at some point this week - Trump is slated to visit a technical school in Wisconsin on Tuesday and will deliver a policy speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

Apprenticeship programs are typically partnerships between a school and an employer that the federal or state governments certify.

Workers are trained for skills and provided with hands-on experience - something the boating industry has long said is lacking when workers emerge from tech programs.

Because workers are paid while they learn, the programs can attract younger Americans who are seeking to avoid student debt, as well as displaced older workers who need new skills but can't attend years of college.

The Labor Department said there were more than 6 million job openings in April - the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure in 2000."
1795,Chelsey Frankford,6/13/2017  10:00 PM,"Have you heard about President Donald Trump?s apprenticeship initiative?  Let?s recap ? Trump wants to see more apprenticeship opportunities in an effort to:

    Decrease unemployment.
    Give job seekers the skills they need to land jobs.
    Help employers fill open positions with the right candidates.

What does this mean for your company?  If you already have an apprenticeship program or are thinking about starting one, you may want to consider getting involved with the Veteran Administration?s GI Bill Apprenticeship Credit program. There are many benefits to getting involved including:

    Veterans are hard-working, eager to learn, and determined to succeed, making them ideal candidates.
    Your company will gain access to the veteran talent pool, so you can hand pick your apprentices.
    Employers generally pay a reduced apprenticeship wage (which initially must be at least 50% of journeyman wage).  
    The VA will provide veterans a monthly housing allowance which will be based on the length of the training."
1796,Kathryn Moody,6/13/2017  3:00 PM,"The Trump administration officially declared its support for apprenticeships by asking federal agencies to consider and remove regulations that could stifle creation of such programs, Bloomberg reports. Another announcement is expected Wednesday on workforce development.  This week, known as Apprenticeship Week in media circles, will see President Trump visiting a technical school in Wisconsin to espouse support for vocational programs. The Trump family, including Ivanka Trump (who is visiting Wisconsin with her father), has spoken out about the need to train Americans for the millions of job openings throughout the country.  However, Trump's DOL budget cuts funding from some federal programs that were allegedly supposed to support skills initiatives. Trump staffers claim the cuts are about the ""accountability and effectiveness"" of the programs.

Apprenticeships are one of the hotter words in the workplace development world right now, as more industries are finding worth in providing alternatives to four-year college and creating pipelines of young talent. Industries like construction and manufacturing face a massive brain drain as older workers begin to retire, since few young workers are willing to take up the reins so far.  Employers are struggling to overcome the ""image gap"" ? a perception that working in certain industries leads to dead-ends or backbreaking work with little chance for promotion. In order to overcome these perceptions, some companies have partnered with local schools (even as young as middle school) to inform students about the real opportunities that exist in these industries. "
1798,Laurie Kellman & Josh Boak - Associated Press,6/13/2017  5:03 AM,"President Donald Trump says apprenticeships could match workers with millions of open jobs, but he?s reluctant to devote more taxpayer money to the effort.  Instead, Trump and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta say the administration is focused on getting universities and private companies to pair up and pay the cost of such learn-to-earn arrangements.

The president has accepted a challenge from Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff to create 5 million apprenticeships over five years. Now, as part of a week-long apprenticeship push, he is visiting Waukesha Technical College in Wisconsin Tuesday with his daughter, Ivanka, as well as Acosta and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.  ?Apprenticeships are going to be a big, big factor in our country,? Trump said during his first-ever full Cabinet meeting Monday. ?There are millions of good jobs that lead to great careers, jobs that do not require a four-year degree or the massive debt that often comes with those four-year degrees and even two-year degrees.?"
1807,Chuck Raasch,6/13/2017 11:41 AM,"WASHINGTON President Donald Trump said Monday he'll announce an initiative later this week aimed at getting technical training apprenticeships for people without college degrees.

""The apprenticeships. A very good word from the Trump standpoint, the word 'apprentice',"" he said during a cabinet meeting on Monday, and that reference to Trump's NBC reality show of that name drew laughs from around the table.

""Apprenticeships are going to be a big, big factor in our country.""

The question: Will they be a factor for those not only without a college degree, which Trump said is an important labor-market sector to address, but for those without a high school diploma?

Simultaneously with Trump's comments in the White House, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and others were holding an event in Chicago focusing on the dismal job prospects of those without a high school degree.

Durbin and Chicago-area officials released a report by the University of Illinois-Chicago's Great Cities Institute that said that the U.S. treasury will lose an estimated $9.5 billion in future tax revenue from current jobless people in Illinois who have no high school degree.

Trump will visit the Department of Labor Wednesday to tout the initiative.

""Americans want to work,"" Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta told reporters on Monday.

He said there are 360,000 job vacancies in manufacturing and 200,000 in construction.

Acosta said the administration would try to expand the number of apprenticeships beyond the current level, which is about 3 percent of the current workforce.

Trump, he said, is ""Very familiar"" with apprenticeships through his work with construction through the years.

The Trump initiative through the Labor Department comes in the wake of several other more controversial initiatives.

Acosta has decided to let go through, for now, a ""Fiduciary rule"" that would require financial advisers to put the interests of clients first that is opposed by many Republicans, including Reps.

Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, and Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-St. Elizabeth, who have been vocal opponents from their positions on the House Financial Services Committee.

Critics have also pointed out that so far, the Trump administration has not committed to spending any more for apprenticeship programs than the $90 million spent by President Barack Obama, and that it is proposing to cut other government labor-market initiatives.

Acosta told reporters that the Trump administration would push for more private initiatives in this and other labor-market development programs, saying that simply spending money on something doesn't make it better.

He used, as an example, the possibility of encouraging more apprenticeship programs to be twinned with people getting college degrees, citing the case of a former student who wanted to be a police officer but got a college degree without being qualified for it.

""Stay tuned for the announcement,"" Acosta said.

On Monday Durbin and others who gathered for a press conference in Chicago painted a grim picture for job possibilities for young people without a high school diploma.

Cook County is the epicenter of what could be long-term economic problems in this subgroup, according to the report.

That county alone has more than 21,000 people aged 16-24 who don't have a job or a high school diploma, the report said.

That's nearly half - 44 percent - of all the people that age without a degree in the entire state of Illinois, according to the study.

""The best anti-poverty, anti-crime, anti-violence program is a job,"" Durbin said.

Durbin and others at the press conference pointed out that many of the chronically employed in this minimally educated age group are technically not included in the national unemployment figures because they have given up looking for work.

Durbin and Trump haven't agreed on much since the president took office, but they do on that point.

""While we have the lowest number in terms of unemployment in many many years at the same time I have always argued with that number because it doesn't take into account the millions and millions of people who have given up looking for jobs. And we are going to be doing something about that and we are going to be getting those people back to work.""

""I call them the forgotten men and women,"" Trump said.

""But they are not going to be forgotten much longer.""

He then touted the upcoming announcement, potentially later this week, on an apprenticeship initiative by his administration.

48,108 - Number of jobless Illinois residents who don't have a high school diploma, according to the UIC study.

197,055 - What an employed person in that above cohort would pay in federal income taxes over his or her lifetime if employed, according to the report.

9.5 billion - The loss on the federal treasury from Illinois alone if none of those in that group of more than 48,000 never becomes employed.

1808,Jennifer DeWitt,6/13/2017 11:59 PM,"Across the Quad-City region, apprenticeships are the foundation of many careers.  Workers in the building and skilled trades, advanced manufacturing, technology, culinary arts and more are getting their start in the workplace through an apprenticeship.   ""That's really how we fill our future workforce ? through the apprentice programs,"" said Jerry Lack, executive director of the Tri-City Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents the Quad-City region's construction trades.

Apprenticeships offer students a program ""where they earn while they learn,"" he said.  Working alongside trained journeymen, apprentices learn the various trades through a combination of on-the-job-training, classroom work and field work. The training ? offered free to the student ? is supported financially by the contractors and the journeymen, Lack said."
1809,Staff,6/13/2017 2:45 PM,"Don't want to borrow to get the education you need to land a high-paying job?

A coding bootcamp is now paying students to learn computer programming, rather than charging tuition - and guaranteeing them jobs when they graduate.

The Virginia-based company, called Revature, is setting up classrooms at college campuses around the country and recruiting college graduates for a free 40-hour-per-week, 12-week crash course in hot skills like Java and data management.

The students receive minimum wage during the course.

In return, graduates commit to working for Revature for two years, at an annual salary of anywhere from $50,000 to $65,000.

Since November, Revature has set up paid immersion classes at two colleges: Arizona State University and Queens College in New York.

Company officials say they plan to start offering similar classes at the University of Missouri in June, and George Mason University later in the year.

They say they hope to add additional campuses later in the year.

Including another group of college grads that are taking classes at the company's headquarters in Reston, Va. - and living in a company dorm - Revature says it is currently paying at least 150 students to learn, and hopes to double that number within a year.

Revature is hardly the only coding bootcamp competing for would-be programmers.

Many of its rivals charge high tuition - some in excess of $15,000 for a three-month program - and some yield mixed results for their graduates, leaving them stuck with big debt and weak job prospects.

By offering an alternative to the use of student loans to fund higher education, Revature's program has won praise from some students, college officials and educational experts.

Rikki Katz, who graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science from Queens College in 2015, says she was thrilled to get a spot in her alma mater's first Revature class.

She hadn't been able to land a tech job on her own, in part because she had spent most of her first year after college teaching, rather than programming.

""A lot of people think that finding jobs in programming is easy right now. But companies are looking for a lot of experience, which is hard to get,"" she says.

The $11 hourly wage she received during the class helped her and her husband pay their rent, and meant she didn't have to take on any additional debt for the skills tuneup.

Katz was placed at a programming job at a finance company after she graduated from Revature in March.

The company may find it difficult to keep its graduates employed for two years, and thus not be able to recoup its investment in the students, for example.

The students Revature wants to recruit may eventually find it more profitable to fund their own education and then take whatever job they want; fully trained starting software engineers often command salaries in excess of $70,000 a year.

Despite the risks, Revature is one of a growing number of coding boot camps and colleges offering free tuition to students willing to share a percentage of their earnings after graduation.

The number of other companies offering apprenticeships - where new workers learn while they earn a reduced salary - has also risen sharply, says Robert Lerman, an American University economist who studies apprenticeships.

The U.S. Department of Labor says there were 505,000 Americans in formal apprenticeships in the fall of 2016, up from 375,000 in the fall of 2013.

Many other countries, such as Germany and Australia, have large apprenticeship programs, notes Lerner.

""Apprenticeships are in the air"" here in the U.S., he adds, partially as a result of the growing backlash against big student debt.

Joe Vacca, chief marketing officer for Revature, says that so far there's no sign the company will have any trouble finding new students willing to make the two-year commitment - nor keeping its graduates employed.

""Because of the pressure on immigration, more companies are looking at how to hire U.S. citizens,"" he said.

""Revature is a great model"" for helping Americans get in-demand skills, says Rick O'Donnell, CEO of Skills Fund, an Austin-based lender to students at other coding boot camps.

Revature only profits if its students are wanted by other employers, so it is highly motivated to make sure students get the best training possible, he says.

It at least gives students who want training without debt an option.

""Some students are very debt-averse,"" he adds.

""The risk of knowing they will have a job might be worth making a little less the first few years,"" he added."
1810,Tribune,6/13/2017 6:13 AM,"Western Wisconsin is receiving about $120,000 in grants to help train more than 130 high school students in the trades.

Gov. Scott Walker announced $3.9 million in Youth Apprenticeship grants awards last week.

The program, administered by the Department of Workforce Development, will help more than 4,300 high school juniors and seniors gain academic and technical instruction with mentored on-the-job training over a period of up to two years.

One of the grants issued by the DWD to Cooperative Educational Service Agency 4 in La Crosse County totals $95,400 and will serve 106 local high school juniors or seniors.

The students will have training opportunities in 11 DWD-approved career pathways, enabling Youth Apprentices to select from a broad range of offerings including architecture, construction, finance, health science, information technology and manufacturing.

The other local grant was awarded to Trempealeau Valley totaling $24,390 to serve 30 local high school juniors and seniors.

The consortium, which is made up of the Whitehall and Blair-Taylor school districts, provides training opportunities in agriculture, architecture, construction finance, health services, hospitality, information technology and manufacturing.

""Wisconsin's nationally-recognized Youth Apprenticeship program helps employers across the state address the skills gap and remains a key talent development strategy,"" Walker said in an announcement of the grants.

""Increased grant funding for the upcoming school year ensures more Wisconsin high school students will become youth apprentices and graduate with the high-demand job skills and industry certification required by our businesses."""
1812,Danielle Paquette,6/13/2017 7:23 AM,"Before he landed the apprenticeship that doubled his wages, Ron Robinson learned how to drive a forklift, mix cement and perform CPR. This training, he said, set him up for the lucrative construction job - and he got it all for free.

Over the past year, the Milwaukee resident went from cleaning houses for $12 an hour to helping demolish them for $24. Now Robinson fears President Trump's proposed cuts to the country's job-training programs could jeopardize the very service the 49-year-old thanks for his upward mobility.

On Tuesday, Trump, his older daughter Ivanka Trump and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta will travel to a technical college in Waukesha County, Wis. - 20 miles from Robinson's home - to highlight the administration's plan to downsize government-funded job training programs and replace them with private-sector partnerships.

The Trumps plan to tour job-training classrooms, meet with local business owners and talk about ways to connect job seekers to talent-hungry companies.

That's particularly challenging in places like Waukesha County, where the unemployment rate is 3.2 percent - significantly lower than the nation's rate of 4.3 percent.

Employers in such areas can have trouble filling roles, even as they raise wages, Ivanka Trump noted in a press call last week.

""The reality is that there are still Americans seeking employment despite low unemployment rates, and companies are struggling to fill vacancies for positions that require various levels of skills and training,"" she said.

""So the Trump administration is committed to working very closely to close the skills gap.""

A White House spokesman said the president wants to tackle this issue by expanding apprenticeships and deploying federal funds more efficiently.

Further details, they said, will come Wednesday in a labor policy speech.

Critics accuse Trump of hurting the people he says he wants to help.

The president's budget proposal for 2018 called for slashing $2.5 billion from the Labor Department's $9.6 billion budget, a reduction of about 21 percent, according to an analysis from the National Skills Coalition, a national worker advocacy group.

That includes a 40 percent cut to the Labor Department's Wagner-Peyser Employment Service, which supports about 14 million job seekers annually and last year helped nearly 6 million people find jobs, and a $1.3 billion reduction to programs that operate under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which Congress reauthorized in a bipartisan move three years ago.

Author Angela Hanks, associate director for workforce policy at the Center for American Progress, said the reduced funding to WIOA initiatives could lead to about 571,000 adults and teenagers losing access to the job training opportunities in 2018.

In her remarks last week, Ivanka Trump, who also works as assistant to the president, said raising more awareness about the benefits of apprenticeships will play a vital role in the White House's workforce development approach.

The administration said only ""Unnecessary, overlapping, outdated and ineffective programs"" will be part of the rollback, according to Trump's proposal.

""To have substantial cuts right at the moment where states are implementing these strategies creates a real challenge,"" he said.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economist at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute who served on Trump's transition team, said the budget cuts are intended to eliminate costly redundancies.

""Closing down programs that don't work and adding funds to those that do work would be a big step forward,"" she said.

Apprenticeships, she added, put more people to work as they upgrade their skills.

Economic development leaders in Wisconsin are concerned that cutting Labor Department funds will hurt job seekers who desire to nab an apprenticeship.

Dawn Pratt, a human resources executive at Payne and Dolan, a construction firm in Waukesha, said federal money has helped support workers who want to take these entry-level construction roles but lack adequate knowledge of the job.

That includes reaching out to people in economically disadvantaged communities, she said, and helping them prepare for math-based tests that employers often require.

""One of the things we're working on a lot now with some of the grants that are coming down is apprenticeship readiness,"" said Pratt, who sits on Gov. Scott Walker's workforce investment council.

""Years ago, we didn't have to do that because you had actual trade training in schools.""

Nowadays, she said, young people don't know about the path to make good money without a college degree.

""When you're in areas where there's not a lot of income, and there's not that generational influence, how would you even know about apprenticeships?"" she said.

""How to prepare for it? How do you pass that exam? Half the people we reach don't know the opportunity exists.""

One focus that appears to have escaped the cuts was apprenticeships.

Trump maintained Barack Obama's $90 million in funding for apprenticeship programs.

Mark Kessenich, president of the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership/BIG STEP, said his organization trains about 800 people each year on how to prepare for apprenticeships in the building trades.

Robinson was one of them - he finished the program last December.

A construction firm in town immediately hired him as an apprentice doing odd jobs - preparing paint, tearing out old flooring - as he trained to become a journeyman.

Robinson, who now rents a two-bedroom apartment, feels he is on track to buying a four-bedroom house with a big back yard.

""It's a lot of hours,"" he said of his BIG STEP training, ""But you have to start off slow before you get to running, you know?"".

Construction companies hire on average 85 percent of BIG STEP participants, Kessenich said - but draining federal resources could stall the initiative.

His organization receives financial awards from the state workforce development board, which receives funding from the Labor Department.

Last year, about a third of his budget - $1 million - came from those grants.

It's unclear how the cuts could affect his program.

""When you cut resources, you cut access to properly trained workers. You get what you pay for."""
1813,Vince Golle,6/13/2017 7:47 AM,"America's labor market is at cruising altitude.

President Donald Trump wants to give it even more elevation.

Unemployment reached a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May and payrolls have increased by more than 15 million since the end of the last recession in June 2009.

A record number of job openings shows companies remain on the hunt for workers and dismissals are near their lowest since the 1970s.

As a tighter job market leaves more and more companies unsuccessful in their bid to fill slots with skilled laborers, the pace of hiring is cooling.

The reduced availability of available workers, along with limited pricing power, may explain why wage growth has been modest.

The so-called skills gap is front and center on Trump's radar as he readies a plan to expand apprenticeship opportunities and build on years of labor-market progress.

The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show job openings climbed to an all-time high of 6.04 million in April, outpacing hiring by almost 1 million for the widest gap in records back to 2000.

Unfilled positions jumped in the leisure and hospitality industry.

The construction trade also saw an increase in openings, while manufacturing vacancies are near their post-recession high.

While the economy has been adding jobs at a decent clip for years, wage growth has been slower to mount.

There are signs that could be starting to change.

Pay increased 2.5 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, matching the second-biggest gain since 2008, according to the Labor Department's data on employment costs.

Where the Wage Growth IsGoods producers:Service providers:Construction:Retail: Health Care:Leisure:Transportation: +2.6%, matches biggest gain since 4Q 2008+2.

What's more, the share of smaller companies in May who raised compensation is close to a decade high because positions are hard to fill, National Federation of Independent Business figures show.

President Trump, who campaigned on reinserting the long-term unemployed into the workforce, on Wednesday will outline an initiative aimed at improving the Labor Department's apprenticeship program, which allows those enrolled to earn a starting salary while participating in training and education.

The program may appeal to both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill in that it provides enhancement of skills desired by employers, and could help boost pay.

Apprenticeships could also reopen the door to more employment of America's prime-age workers.

One of the remaining areas of slack in the current labor market has been a decline in labor-force participation that started under President George W. Bush and picked up steam during President Barack Obama's term.

""Americans want to work. American companies want to hire. The issue is a mismatch between available jobs and prospective employees' job skills,"" Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said Monday at a White House press briefing."
1815,Patrick Gillespie,6/13/2017 8:42 AM,"The White House is dubbing it ""Workforce development week"" and has filled the president's schedule with workplace visits, speeches and roundtable discussions on the subject.

The aim is to present a fix to a big U.S. problem: job skills.

What's clear: Trump wants to make a big commitment to expand apprenticeship programs.

What's unclear: How his budget will pay for it and whether apprenticeships alone can fix the country's massive job skills gap.

Trump's budget proposal allocates $90 million for grants to apprenticeships, but it slashes funding for current job training programs by $1.1 billion, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

President Obama allocated the same amount of money for apprenticeships last year.

Experts say that size and scale of what is required present their own challenges.

There are 6.8 million unemployed Americans actively looking for a job.

There were only 450,000 apprentices last year, excluding those in military apprenticeships, and the average program had 24 apprentices.

""You have to create a lot of programs, double or quadruple, before apprenticeships become a lever that's really scalable in helping us to close the skills gap,"" says David Blake, CEO of Degreed, an education technology firm.

All sides agree: The U.S. needs to better train its workers.

There were 6 million job openings in April, a record high.

About 95% of employers say they're having difficulty finding skilled and available workers, according to a recent survey by Business Roundtable.

Experts are encouraged by the administration's plan to invest in apprenticeships, but caution that they aren't the only solution to train workers.

""We're excited that the momentum on apprenticeships continues,"" says Eric Seleznow, former deputy assistant secretary at the Labor Department under Obama and an adviser at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future.

""Apprenticeship is great, but it's not the only tool in the toolbox.""

Seleznow argues that apprenticeships are best for workers with some skills and educational background, but for those lacking basic skills, job training programs tend to offer more classroom time.

The number of apprentices fell from 488,000 in 2003 to 285,000 in 2012.

That number rose back up to 450,000 by last year, in part due to the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

Historically, job training programs had a bad legacy.

The Labor Department's own 2012 study concluded that a job training program was ineffective for workers who have their jobs shipped overseas.

It didn't place workers in jobs they wanted and the jobs they did get often paid far less than their previous ones.

White House officials say the current setup for job training programs doesn't make sense: There are 31 different job training programs across 14 government agencies.

Despite the checkered history, job training and apprenticeships appeared to turn the corner after Republicans and Democrats passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in 2014.

It provided federal funding for new types of apprenticeships and job training where local employers organize with community colleges and job training programs to identify the skills needed for nearby jobs.

Per Scholas is a job training program in six cities, including Atlanta, Dallas and Cleveland.

About 80% of its graduates are placed in a job within four months of finishing.

Apprenticeship Carolina, a state-run program, develops apprenticeship programs for employers at no cost for them.

It's received lots of praise, including from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.

Nationwide, apprenticeship programs have increased to 21,339 last year from 19,260 in 2014.

Still, back in 2001 there were over 33,000 programs."
1840,Eric Morath,6/15/2017  3:56 PM,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to reduce barriers to apprenticeships, testing whether a system that has long delivered good-paying jobs to American construction workers might help other businesses bridge skills gaps.  The White House is making apprenticeships the cornerstone of its workforce-training efforts, arguing that hands-on learning is the best approach to prepare Americans for in-demand jobs. Worker shortages are causing businesses to slow investment, the administration says. Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training and classroom education, with participants earning a credential recognized by the federal government.

The order directs the Labor Department to allow companies, trade associations and unions to develop their own apprenticeship-program guidelines. Those would be reviewed for quality, but the government would generally take a lighter touch than it does with current programs.  ?We?re empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens,? Mr. Trump said just before signing the order in the White House. ?Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees.?"
1841,Noam Scheiber,6/15/2017  4:00 PM,"President Trump is taking one the most concrete steps of his presidency on Thursday to address the employment prospects of workers left behind by the current economic expansion. In doing so, he also joins a long-running and occasionally contentious debate over whether those workers have the skills they need to land desirable jobs.  Mr. Trump?s action comes in the form of an executive order expanding federally funded apprenticeship programs. The order would create a category of programs that industry groups and other third parties could develop and then submit for Labor Department approval, rather than working within existing department guidelines.  ?Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees,? Mr. Trump said. ?Instead apprentices earn while they learn.?

Mr. Trump would redirect over $100 million of federal job training money to pay for the new apprenticeships, supplementing $90 million in funding for the existing program.  Corporate groups hailed the idea of expanding apprenticeship programs and making them more flexible, arguing that apprenticeships are a reliable path to good-paying jobs in sectors like retail and hospitality for those who could no longer support themselves in production sectors like manufacturing."
1844,Roy Maurer Jun 14,6/15/2017 1:05 PM,"A pair of bipartisan senators introduced legislation today that would provide a $5,000 tax credit to employers that hire people from registered apprenticeship programs.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, introduced their bill aimed at closing the national skills gap as the White House is making a series of announcements on apprenticeships this week.

The Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act of 2017 goes further than President Donald Trump's actions, according to Cantwell's office, ""Creating a concrete, powerful incentive for businesses and workers to embrace apprenticeship programs, accelerating the adoption of the apprenticeship model, and helping businesses refocus on the benefits of training and educating their workers.""

Apprenticeship programs offer an alternative to a four-year college degree and allow student workers to learn in-demand skills with on-the-job training and, often, an educational component.

Employers invest in talent in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period.

Support of apprenticeships and other alternative career pathways has been advocated as a solution for industries like construction and manufacturing that have had trouble hiring qualified workers to replace retiring employees and has found favor in the technology sector, which also faces a large skills gap.

According to the Washington, D.C.-based National Skills Coalition, an advocacy organization aimed at advancing national investments in workforce development, 53 percent of U.S. jobs are middle-skilled, meaning that they require some form of postsecondary education and training beyond high school but not a four-year degree.

Only 43 percent of U.S. workers are trained at this level.

""Employers across a range of industries struggle to find skilled workers, and apprenticeship and other work-based learning strategies are getting increased attention as a solution,"" said Kermit Kaleba, federal policy director for the National Skills Coalition.

Create a $5,000 tax credit for up to three years for companies that hire individuals enrolled in a federal- or state-registered apprenticeship program.

Employers that participate in a multiemployer apprenticeship program would be eligible to receive a credit of $3 per hour that each individual enrolled in the program works.

Cantwell claimed that the bill would establish ""The first-ever national incentive for apprentice programs.""Allow senior employees near retirement to draw from their pensions early if they're involved in the mentoring or training of new employees.

Workers must be at least 55 years old and must spend at least 20 percent of their time training or educating employees or students.

Help veterans get into skilled jobs that match their military experience sooner by allowing credit in apprenticeship requirements for previous military training.

""The upfront costs for setting up apprenticeships can be daunting, particularly for small and medium-sized employers,"" Kaleba said.

""The Cantwell-Collins bill offers one key tool to address the challenges employers face, and it's a step toward creating pathways to good jobs for U.S. workers.""

1846,Kaylee Johnston,6/15/2017 10:22 AM,"By Kaylee Johnston, Special to the Telegram & Gazette WORCESTER - YouthBuild partnered with Saint-Gobain for a volunteer day to install new vinyl siding on Friendly House after more than 40 years of painted-over deterioration.

Seventeen YouthBuild teens and young adults and 11 Saint-Gobain volunteers split into three groups Wednesday to finish the YouthBuild project on the two-story building that has been underway for about a week.

Friendly House, open since 1920, is a multi-service community center that offers shelter, emergency help, food, medical care, classes and more to inner-city families.

""In three years Friendly House will be 100 years old. We've been in the neighborhood ever since and so this is a fine way for us to take a look at the next 100 years in terms of what a wonderful job we've done,"" said Gordon Hargrove, executive director of Friendly House.

YouthBuild, a Training Resources of America program, offers hands-on construction skills training and high school equivalency test preparation to at-risk youth ages 16-24.

Upon the completion of the yearlong program of community service, education and a big construction project, the students are given the Home Builders Institute Pre-Apprenticeship Certificate Training certificate as well as the opportunity to earn their high school equivalency diploma.

""YouthBuild is very much to my heart. I love what they do,"" said Kim Harmon, president and CEO of Training Resources of America.

""You're putting back into the community, and that's just something special. When you drive by you're going to see Friendly House and say, 'Remember that day we did the siding on that?' When you see different things you're doing in the community it also sets home with you, that's why I love it.""

A product donation, estimated at $15,000, from Saint-Gobain's sister company CertainTeed made the project possible, according to Brenda Heller of Saint-Gobain.

""Our organizations have had a relationship for about 50 years, and about eight years ago it blossomed with the YouthBuild Worcester organization,"" said Bradley H. Johnson, vice president of Saint-Gobain Abrasives in North America.

YouthBuild has been around since 1999, but Saint-Gobain wasn't focused on the program until 2010.

Although the organizations have all been intertwined for years, this is the first event when all three of the organizations were able to meet up and work together on a project.

""We've been long-standing partners with Saint-Gobain and also with Friendly House, and I know we do a lot of community service work besides our regular basic projects that we do. We've built two houses with Friendly House in the past from the ground up,"" Ms. Harmon said.

""I know Friendly House was in need of having the siding done. They had tried painting it before and it just didn't work. So we got the product donation and the people here to do it, and we just thought it was a nice match and to give a nice volunteer community day at Friendly House."""
1847,Staff,6/15/2017 11:09 AM,"President Trump is putting a spotlight Thursday on his administration's efforts to broaden the reach of private-sector apprenticeship programs, part of an effort to close a ""Skills gap"" that the White House says is leaving millions of jobs unfilled.

Trump plans to sign an executive order that would reorient and expand ApprenticeshipUSA, a grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration and has been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.

The administration's aim, according to White House officials, is to give more flexibility to third parties - including businesses, trade associations and labor unions - to design programs that will offer skills training to those who are seeking jobs for which they are not yet qualified.

Under current rules, the Labor Department is too heavy handed in crafting the programs, a senior White House official said before Trump's announcement, expected late Thursday morning.

""The process is simply too hard,"" the official said, saying Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump will also use ""The bully pulpit"" that the White House provides to encourage more businesses to create apprenticeship programs.

The administration is seeking to broaden the use of such programs beyond manufacturing to other sectors, including health care and accounting, the official said.

Trump wants to expand the program's budget to about $200 million, roughly twice its existing level, by redirecting other money from the Labor Department, the official, who briefed the media on the condition of anonymity, told reporters.

White House officials say they are seeking bipartisan support for their job-training initiative, a different tack than Trump has used in trying to push through marquee legislation on health care and tax reform.

In his yet-unrealized efforts to revamp the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes, Trump and congressional Republicans are trying to use a parliamentary maneuver that would allow them to pass bills without any Democratic buy-in.

Trump has decried Democrats as ""Obstructionists"" to his initiatives.

Last year, the Obama administration trumpeted its efforts to expand apprenticeship programs, including $90 million secured in the budget for ApprenticeshipUSA through a bipartisan agreement.

""Apprenticeships are among the surest pathways to provide American workers from all backgrounds with the skills and knowledge they need to acquire good-paying jobs and grow the economy,"" the Obama administration said in a news release at the time.

The executive order Trump is set to sign Thursday also establishes a task force to recommend ways to promote apprenticeships and directs the Labor Department to evaluate the effectiveness of its various job-training programs.

Trump spent 14 seasons as host of the NBC reality show ""The Apprentice,"" and administration officials have sought to play that down in selling this initiative.

Trump had planned to sign the executive order on apprenticeships during a trip to the Labor Department on Wednesday, but that visit was canceled after a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.."
1850,Laurie Kellman Associated Press,6/15/2017 11:34 AM,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered more money and a bigger role for private companies in designing apprenticeship programs meant to fill some of the 6 million open jobs in the U.S. Trump signed an executive order to roughly double to $200 million the taxpayer money spent on learn-to-earn programs.

The money would come from existing job training programs.

The executive order would leave it to industry to design apprenticeships under broad standards to be set by the Labor Department.

""We're training people to have great jobs and high paying jobs,"" Trump said at a White House ceremony.

""We're here today to celebrate the dignity of work and the greatness of the American worker.""

Trump is directing the government to review and streamline some 43 workforce programs across 13 agencies.

Senior administration officials have said Trump was reluctant to spend more federal funds on apprenticeships, so the boost would come from existing money, perhaps from the streamlining process.

The officials spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to preview Trump's order.

Companies have long complained that they can't find trained people to fill highly technical jobs, and apprenticeship programs have sprung up around the country.

Companies now have to register with the Labor Department and adhere to government guidelines.

There are about 500,000 apprenticeship positions in the U.S. Trump had campaigned on creating jobs.

The executive order addresses the nation's ""Skills gap"" that have left millions of open jobs unfilled.

Apprenticeships would give students a way to learn skills without the crippling debt of four-year colleges, and expand those opportunities to women, minorities and other populations underrepresented among the nation's roughly 505,000 apprentices.

Trump accepted a challenge earlier this year from a CEO to create 5 million new apprenticeships.

""The Trump administration has said there's a need that can be met with a change in the American attitude toward vocational education and apprenticeships. A November 2016 report by former President Barack Obama's Commerce Department found that""apprenticeships are not fully understood in the United States, especially"" by employers, who tend to use apprentices for a few, hard-to-fill positions"" but not as widely as they could.

The shortages for specifically trained workers cut across multiple job sectors, from construction trades to agriculture, manufacturing, information technology and health care.

Critics say Trump can't be promoting apprenticeships while he proposes cutting federal job training funding by as much as 40 percent - from $2.7 billion to $1.6 billion.

There also are questions about oversight of apprenticeship programs that begin and operate almost completely under the control of the company.

Of the 146 million jobs in the United States, about 0.35 percent - or slightly more than a half-million - were filled by active apprentices in 2016.

Filling millions more jobs through apprenticeships would require the government to massively ramp up its efforts.

""Scaling is the big issue,"" said Robert Lerman, a fellow at the Urban Institute.

Another complication: only about half of apprentices finish their multi-year programs.

Fewer than 50,000 people - including 11,104 in the military - completed their apprenticeships in 2016, according to Labor Department.

Trump's resume includes the hit television show, ""The Apprentice."""
1855,Globe Newswire,6/15/2017 2:01 PM,"The Executive Order will streamline the administrative process of the current apprenticeship program by shifting the certification from the Department of Labor to industry; encouraging apprenticeships in colleges, high schools and other entities; and most importantly will double funding for apprenticeship programs.

""Apprenticeships create more affordable education and job training, especially for those Americans who want to work in the hospitality, restaurant and foodservice industry. The National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation has already begun creating and implementing our apprenticeship program and with today's Executive Order we will have even more opportunities to help employees in the hospitality industry move up the ladder for fulfilling and rewarding careers,"" stated Dawn Sweeney, President and CEO of the National Restaurant Association.

Last year, the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation was awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Labor to create the first ever federally registered hospitality sector apprenticeship program.

Together with the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the NRAEF launched the Hospitality Sector Registered Apprenticeship project.

Through this project, we will identify at least 450 apprentices in the restaurant, foodservice and hospitality industry, and put them on a defined pathway to management-level positions through on-the-job paid training and standardized instruction.

""We are excited about working with the Administration to help create more job and career opportunities in the restaurant, foodservice and hospitality industry through apprenticeship. The Foundation has already begun working with the industry to develop and implement an apprenticeship program that provides the skills and training needed for career advancement across multiple management positions,"" stated Rob Gifford, Executive Vice President, National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation.

Founded in 1919, the National Restaurant Association is the leading business association for the restaurant industry, which comprises 1 million restaurant and foodservice outlets and a workforce of more than 14.7 million employees.

We represent the industry in Washington, D.C., and advocate on its behalf.

We operate the industry's largest trade show; leading food safety training and certification program; unique career-building high school program.

As the philanthropic foundation of the National Restaurant Association, the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation's mission of service to the public is dedicated to enhancing the industry's training and education, career development and community engagement efforts.

The NRAEF and its programs work to Attract, Empower and Advance today's and tomorrow's restaurant and foodservice workforce.

NRAEF programs include: ProStart(R) - a high-school career and technical education program; Restaurant Ready - partnering with community based organizations to provide ""Opportunity youth"" with skills training and job opportunities; Military - helping military servicemen and women transition their skills to restaurant and foodservice careers; Scholarships - financial assistance for students pursuing restaurant, foodservice and hospitality degrees; and, the Hospitality Sector Registered Apprenticeship Project - a partnership with the American Hotel & Lodging Association providing a hospitality apprenticeship program for the industry."
1858,Staff,6/15/2017 3:04 PM,"President Donald Trump should be commended for his Thursday executive order expanding apprenticeship grants.

The simple but unpopular truth is that college isn't right for everyone, and there are many fulfilling and rewarding careers in the skilled trades.

""Trump's aides said the executive order will make it easier for businesses to operate their own unique apprenticeship programs, cutting back red tape,"" Politico reports.

According to a senior White House official quoted by Politico, ""The Department of Labor to date has been very prescriptive and very restrictive on the apprenticeship programs, but the Department of Labor is not an expert as to various individual sectors and what the qualifications are. So we're going to let the industry put forth its proposals as to what should make up a high-quality apprenticeship program. But the Department of Labor still sits over and above it and still adjudicates it at the end of the day.""

As the Labor Department notes, ""Nine in 10 Americans who complete apprentice training land a job, and their average starting salary is $60,000 a year.""

The apprenticeship program has broad bipartisan support.

""Apprenticeships typically take the form of an employer and some type of education provider teaming up to offer hands-on training to prospective workers,"" explains Andy Smarick of the American Enterprise Institute.

""Most apprenticeships are government certified. Importantly, apprenticeships are paid, making them attractive to older workers who can't go without an income and younger workers hoping to avoid borrowing for further education.""

The U.S. has the strange combination of a low labor force participation rate, along with an awful lot of unfilled jobs, particularly in skilled trade areas.

The problem is that many of those who are out of work lack the specific skills to fill those open positions.

Apprenticeship programs, run by the companies who know what their needs are, will help address this massive mismatch.

""Apprenticeship opportunities should be determined by firms, not by bureaucrats,"" writes Michael Strain, also with AEI. ""The funding for apprenticeship programs should come from existing job-training funds, as well as from college aid. The college-for-all model needs to be shelved; the marginal dollar of college aid would be better spent here in many cases.""

""Not every young person is suited to four years of college,"" Reich wrote recently.

""They may be bright and ambitious but they won't get much out of it. They'd rather be doing something else, like making money or painting murals. They feel compelled to go to college because they've been told over and over that a college degree is necessary. Yet if they start college and then drop out, they feel like total failures. Even if they get the degree, they're stuck with a huge bill - and may be paying down their student debt for years. And all too often the jobs they land after graduating don't pay enough to make the degree worthwhile.""

The Trump administration is doing the right thing by helping to provide for alternatives to college."
1860,Staff,6/15/2017 3:44 PM,"President Donald Trump announced Thursday a plan to make apprenticeships the core of his strategy to fight unemployment.

As part of the administration's ""Workforce development week,"" the president's push to train a new generation of workers is geared at matching workers with millions of open jobs and thus, closing the phenomenon known as the ""Skills gap,"" the disparity between the skills employers want and those applicants have.

Critics say the announcement doesn't jive with the deep cuts laid out in his proposed budget, which slashes Labor Department funding by 21% and guts training and employment services aimed at getting unemployed Americans back to work.

As the details begin to roll in, here are four things you should know.1.

What is An Apprenticeship?Apprentice programs combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction - ""Earn while you learn"" is the phrase Trump has used frequently throughout the last week.

Apprenticeships are available across a variety of disciplines, but are most common in the construction, manufacturing, public administration and transportation industries.

Today, Trump mentioned expansion into machinery, tech, steel and ""Roads and bridges.""

As of last year, 505,000 people held apprenticeships in the U.S., according to Department of Labor data.

About half of the all the active apprentices are in construction, and another 35% are in manufacturing.

These programs enjoy a fair amount of bipartisan support, and have gotten a lot of buzz in recent months: In a March roundtable discussion, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called on Trump to create 5 million apprenticeships in the next five years.

Such programs are sometimes tapped as alternatives to four-year colleges.

Trump's apprenticeship rollout, he said Thursday, will ""Place students into great jobs without the crippling debt"" that often comes with it.2.

What's Trump's plan?Trump's speech was light on details, but according to the Associated Press, about $200 million will be used for the new program.

That nearly doubles the existing level and the funds will be used from the Labor Department.

The driving point, officials say, is to give employers, unions and trade groups more flexibility to design their own apprenticeship programs outside the Labor Department's ultra-specific guidelines.

""We have regulations on top of regulations,"" Trump said Thursday.

""We're empowering companies, unions, industry groups and federal agencies to go out and create new opportunities for millions of citizens.""

So How Will This Work With the Trump Budget? While the executive order is being touted as a strategy to fight unemployment, it follows a proposed budget that axes funding to the Labor Department by 21%, drastically reduces the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and slashes grants aimed at getting unemployed Americans back to work.

On Thursday, Trump also touted the importance of getting more women into apprenticeships, but the White House budget eliminates a $1 million women in apprenticeship grants.

""The goals of this program will be met with the broader Apprenticeship program,"" the budget notes.

The proposed budget also drastically reduces funding to the Women's Bureau, the only federal agency responsible for with advocating for working women.

When the president and his daughter Ivanka Trump toured a Wisconsin technical college to promote the plan earlier in the week, Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin said the message from the White House ""Doesn't match the reality of the budget cuts they are proposing.""

Wait, Didn't Obama Have an Apprenticeship Program? Apprenticeships were a priority for the Obama Administration and in 2015, Obama awarded $175 million in apprenticeship grants - the first-ever programmatic funding for registered apprenticeships in the U.S.In 2016, nearly $90 million in grants were appropriated for apprenticeship expansion.

On Twitter Thursday, Chris Lu, Former Deputy Labor Secretary under Obama, said Trump's executive order ""Is simply a funding shift from other training programs."""
1861,Staff,6/15/2017 3:51 PM,"""We want to make sure that we have the workforce development programs we need to ensure these jobs are being filled by American workers."" -President Donald J. Trump.

AMERICAN WORKERS LEFT BEHIND: Many American workers are being left behind as current education and training programs fail to equip them with the skills they need.

Apprenticeships will not only keep jobs in America, but ensure that American workers and trained and hired to fill those jobs.

Despite many available job vacancies, millions of American workers do not have the opportunity to gain the skills necessary to thrive in a 21st century economy.

There are 6 million vacant jobs in the United States, the highest number since 1980.

According to a 2014 Georgetown University study, by 2020, some form of education or training beyond high school will be required for 65 percent of all jobs.

Instead of getting the skills needed to meet new opportunities, Americans are being left with a pile of debt and, in too many cases, no direct pathway to a stable job.

Total student loan debt in the United States is now over $1.4 trillion.

The average student loan debt, for students graduating with debt in the class of 2016, is over $30,000.

Of total aggregate student loan debt, over 11 percent was over 90 days delinquent or in default.

Only 11 percent of employers strongly agree that America's institutions of higher education are teaching graduates the skills their companies need.

Many Federal job-training programs are falling short.

In fiscal year 2017, the Government funded 43 job-training programs across 13 agencies, totaling $16.7 billion, not counting Pell grants.

Many of these programs do not work and must be reformed.

OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICAN WORKERS: President Donald J. Trump is providing opportunity for Americans to gain skills needed to succeed and thrive as the economy grows.

President Trump recognizes the value of skill-focused education and is taking steps to create more options for Americans.

The Executive Order he is signing today takes important steps to expand apprenticeships and improve job-training programs.

The Executive Order: Responds to the desire of third-party groups to create more flexible apprenticeship programs and directs the Department of Labor to allow companies, trade associations, and unions to develop their own ""Industry-recognized apprenticeship"" guidelines, which DOL will review for quality and then approve.

Directs DOL to use available funding to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeships are not currently widespread. Creates a task force that will recommend ways to promote apprenticeships.

Requires all Federal agencies to review and evaluate the effectiveness of their job training programs, and consider how to best consolidate certain programs for increased accountability.

Expanding access to apprenticeships will provide American workers with more options and opportunities to get an affordable education and a well-paying job.

DOL data shows that over 90% of apprentices find employment after completing their program, and their average starting wage is $60,000 annually.

Graduates of apprenticeship programs see a $300,000 lifetime increase in earnings, without the burden of student loan debt.

Congress must act to make it easier for Americans to access education that is affordable, teaches relevant skills, and leads to good jobs.

Having a degree is not enough; Americans need an education that equips them with the tools to succeed.

Job training and higher education programs should be evaluated and reformed to ensure Federal dollars are available for Americans to spend on the courses, programs, and pathways that lead them toward a stable job and a higher paycheck.

A PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is fulfilling his promise to the American people to provide opportunities to succeed as jobs are coming back to the country."
1862,Staff,6/15/2017 3:51 PM,"""The president knows that apprenticeship programs offer demand-based skills and good, stable jobs with reduced or no student debt. And the president knows that apprenticeship programs offer the best way of reducing the skills gap.""

There are 6 million job openings in the United States.

In a Business Roundtable survey of CEOs released just last week, 95 percent of executives reported difficulty finding qualified employees.

Americans want to work; American companies want to hire.

The available jobs do not match the prospective employees' job skills.

This skills gap is a particular challenge in some of the fastest growing sectors of the economy: financial services, health care and information technology.

There are 360,000 job vacancies in manufacturing.

There are also 200,000 available construction jobs, and with President Donald Trump's forthcoming investment in infrastructure, that number will, in all likelihood, increase substantially.

The most obvious and immediate benefit for graduating apprentices is a high-earning job.

Individuals who complete an apprenticeship program, on average, earn a starting wage of more than $60,000 per year.

This is higher than the average starting salary of students who graduate from traditional colleges.

Nearly nine out of 10 are employed upon completing their apprenticeships.

Despite these benefits, apprentices make up only 0.3 percent of the American workforce, with large-scale apprenticeship programs largely limited to the construction sector.

The building trades unions, working together with contractors, spend more than $1 billion per year funding a nationwide network of nearly 1,600 teaching centers.

The industry understands the benefits of skilled workforce and is willing to pay to teach its workers.

Throughout his career, President Trump has seen firsthand the success of apprenticeship programs in the building trades.

Throughout his campaign, as he met with a countless number of Americans, President Trump repeated his commitment to expand job opportunities here in America.

Apprenticeships will be one of the ways that President Trump will deliver on his commitment.

The president knows that apprenticeship programs offer demand-based skills and good, stable jobs with reduced or no student debt.

The president knows that apprenticeship programs offer the best way of reducing the skills gap."
1866,Nicholas Wyman,6/16/2017  4:33 PM,"Apprenticeships are getting a lot of press in the past few days as something of a cure-all for America?s economic woes. Skills shortages are stifling our economy, particularly in global export and advanced high-value manufacturing markets. In fact, across the U.S., industries are begging for talented workers as six million vacancies remain unfilled. Why? Too few Americans have the skill profiles that businesses need.  And in parallel, we pressure our kids to get a college degree thinking ? and believing ? it?s a secure path to a job, career and higher status.

Signing a presidential order Thursday to expand modern apprenticeship, the President made it clear that apprenticeship is a solid career choice for all Americans.  Not a second-class option. And this will help change perceptions.  Apprenticeships are a time-honored system to upskill the young or novices, boost productivity, allow apprentices to earn high wages and secure rewarding careers."
1867,Robert Graboyes,6/16/2017  5:00 PM,"President Trump, like President Obama before him, is touting apprenticeships as a way to revitalize the American labor force. There are good reasons for enthusiasm about this approach and some significant areas for caution. It?s also important to consider apprenticeships as simply part of a broader range of labor market reforms.  Apprenticeships generally involve partnerships between employers and educational institutions. Participants study to gain skills and academic credentials. They also work at paid jobs (not unpaid internships) where their mentors train them for immediately usable skills. President Trump referred to the idea as ?earn while you learn.?

According to the Labor Department, around 90 percent of those completing apprenticeship programs receive job offers when they complete their programs, with average starting salaries around $60,000. Plus, they arrive at that point without accumulating the crushing debts their college-bound contemporaries often accumulate. The federal government plays an oversight role ? enforcing the contractual relationships between schools, employers and apprentices.  The specifics of how the Trump administration will promote apprenticeships remain to be seen, but the broad themes appear to be more federal grants to support the programs, less federal oversight over (interference with?) the programs and greater reliance on non-college sources of educational services (private companies, for example)."
1871,Kathy Gurchiek Jun 16,6/16/2017 1:01 PM,"President Donald Trump issued an executive order on June 15 to expand apprenticeships and vocational training.

The order calls for creating a Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion, an Excellence in Apprenticeship Program and industry-recognized apprenticeships.

It also calls for promoting apprenticeships at colleges and universities and expanding access to apprenticeships.

Finally, it directs the head of each government agency that administers any job-training program to evaluate-using a third party, when feasible-the effectiveness of those efforts.

The U.S. Department of Labor will fund the task force.

The president said his order empowers companies, unions, industry groups and federal agencies ""To go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens."" The directive removes what he called ""Federal restrictions that have prevented many different industries from creating apprenticeship programs."" However, he did not specify what those restrictions are.

CNN reported that the new program will cost $200 million and take some authority away from the DOL, noting that ""The executive order is more of a directive and less a dramatic change in administrative policy."" It quoted one official who said there were 43 separate workforce programs across 13 federal agencies.

The executive order was the latest in a flurry of activity this week by the former host of the TV show ""The Apprentice"" to tout the benefits of experience-based job training.

The president said that he met with some of the nation's governors on the morning of June 15 to discuss how his administration can work with them to expand the workforce training initiative, and the day before he met with CEOs of major U.S. companies who support apprenticeship initiatives.

He originally was scheduled to speak to the DOL on June 14 and sign the executive order then, but that was postponed after a gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice at a park in Alexandria, Va. Trump opened a White House briefing on June 15 by calling for thoughts and prayers for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and his family.

Scalise, who remained in the hospital a day after the shooting, was among those injured.

Trump also praised Capitol Police officers and other first responders for their efforts to save lives.

Earlier in the week, Trump and his eldest daughter, Ivanka, visited Waukesha County Technical College in Milwaukee with 2016 presidential campaign rival Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.

In a speech there, Trump said he wanted all high schools in the U.S. to offer apprenticeships, ""Programs that open up more opportunities for all students, whether they want to go to a four-year college, a technical college, trade school, or work and learn as a skilled apprentice.""

In a White House press briefing June 12, DOL Secretary Alexander Acosta noted that while the average starting salary for apprentices who have completed their training is $60,000, those who have gone through apprenticeship programs make up only 3 percent of the U.S. workforce.

In his executive order, Trump said that expanding apprenticeships and ""Reforming ineffective education and workforce development programs"" will help unemployed Americans gain relevant work experience and skills and help match them with available jobs.

The federal government has certified apprenticeship programs for more than 75 years, according to the DOL, and there are more than 533,000 apprenticeships available in more than 1,000 occupations throughout the U.S. The DOL's Office of Apprenticeship offers the Quick Start Toolkit for employers that want to create an apprenticeship program and information on what an apprenticeship typically entails.

In recent years the U.S. has been looking to European models that ""Provide fast-tracked, on-the-job training in white-collar professions,"" according to The Hechinger Report.

The Report, which covers innovations in education, is a project of the Hechinger Institute on Education and the Media at the Columbia University Teachers College in New York City.

Rebekah Rombom, vice president of career services and business development at the Flatiron School in the greater New York City area, offered organizations some tips for creating apprenticeships.

The school trains students in web development through 12 intensive weeks of instruction, works with organizations to develop curricula that target the job skills they seek in job candidates, and helps companies develop their own apprenticeships.

She said HR professionals should designate a manager who will pair each apprentice with an employee who can answer questions and provide feedback.

HR professionals should also allow time for onboarding.

As with any employee, she said, expect apprentices to take a few weeks to be productive.

""Building an apprenticeship program from scratch can seem like a giant mountain to climb,"" Rombom told SHRM Online in an e-mail.

""But we've worked with companies to build programs that started as small as [having] one apprentice.""

Trump said at the White House event. ?Instead, apprentices earn while they learn.?

The administration did not mention any new money Thursday, but sources said it plans to announce an allocation of up to $200 million, which would be more than double the $90 million for apprenticeships in this year?s federal budget.  The White House has said it wants growth industries that historically have not focused much on apprenticeships, including health care, IT and manufacturing, to expand their offerings."
1877,Eric Duvall,6/16/2017 4:50 AM,"June 15 - President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at increasing apprenticeships and training for blue collar jobs.

The order seeks to expand the number of people qualified to work in the building trades and other manual labor positions, industries that are experiencing a dire shortage of qualified workers.

The federal government estimates there are 6 million jobs unfilled in the building trades.

A part of the problem is too few young people are pursuing careers as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, welders and other more specialized building trades - and the typical four-year college degree doesn't qualify an individual to work in those fields.

By seeking to expand apprenticeships and other trade training programs, Trump said more Americans would be able to find fulfilling work.

The executive order permits industry groups to create their own apprenticeship programs and submit them to the Department of Labor for review and funding.

""We're empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens. Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees. Instead, apprentices earn while they learn,"" Trump said.

The topic of apprenticeships and other workforce development initiatives enjoys bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.

Democrats, backed by organized labor, support programs that will create more union jobs.

Republicans, backed by business interests, want to improve the nation's workforce and fill positions companies need in order to grow.

Trump's executive order also requires all federal agencies that participate in apprenticeship programs or workforce training to examine whether their efforts are duplicative or could be combined with other programs to greater effect.

Trump singled out his daughter and adviser, Ivanka, for her work on the apprenticeship program.

""So I want to thank my daughter Ivanka and her leadership. She has worked so hard on this. She understands how important it is. We're training people to have great jobs and high-paying jobs,"" he said."

1881,Staff,6/16/2017 7:58 AM,"President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order that called for expanding apprenticeships to improve worker training in the United States Thursday.

His own proposed budget would cut other job training programs that advocates say are necessary for this one to thrive.

Trump's Executive Order mandates that the Department of Labor review current federal workforce programs, charging the Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, with developing a program that enables private sector businesses and trade associations to develop their own apprenticeships.

The order will also create a task force to recommend methods of implementation.

""We will be removing federal restrictions that have prevented different industries from creating these programs,"" Trump said at the signing Thursday.

Apprenticeship programs are generally praised on both sides of the aisle.

The White House worked with Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott on the initiative, highlighting it as a ""Truly bipartisan issue."" Bipartisan legislation was also introduced in the House to strengthen the Perkins Act, which provides federal support for technical education by modernizing it for the 21st century, a bill Ivanka Trump praised on Fox and Friends earlier in the week.

Trump's 2018 budget - which Congress is unlikely to pass in full form - would reduce funding for job training programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2014, by 39%, shifting the majority of responsibility of states and employers.

""Around the country, but especially in hard-hit areas in the Rust Belt, federal training and employment services are a powerful way to provide economic opportunities to millions of unemployed and underemployed adults and young people,"" Chris Lu, who served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor during the Obama Administration, wrote in TIME this week.

Both employers and economists agree with the White House that the skills gap - the discrepancy between the number of workers available to do the work and the skills required for the job - is something the country needs to address.

The White House noted that there are currently six million job vacancies in the United States, the highest number in nearly 40 years, but workers don't necessarily have the skills to fill them.

The initiative Trump focused on Thursday would double the funds for the Apprenticeship USA program, bringing the total spending to $200 million a year.

Advocates worry it won't come to fruition if the White House's proposed budget is implemented in Congress.

""The Apprenticeship expansion would not have a negative impact,"" said Maria Flynn, President and CEO of Jobs for the Future, who said she has had informal conversations with the White House about this initiative.

"" The hurt comes if the proposed [budget] cuts are enacted because that would take a toll on lower skilled lower income young people and adults.

Scott, who the White House cited as the Congressional Democrat who worked on the initiative, affirmed the bipartisan support for expanding apprenticeships, but said in a conference call with reporters that the proposed budget cuts are detrimental, and funding should be increased.

Scott would not answer explicitly when asked if he supported the executive order, saying accountability is paramount.

""We need to make sure the programs under the executive order can be measured for quality,"" he said.

A senior Administration official noted during the briefing that the government is channeling billions of dollars into job training programs - in fiscal year 2017 spending on these programs totaled $16.7 billion before Pell grants - that he says have not effectively helped the American worker.

The White House did not respond to additional questions about squaring the possible budget cuts with the expansion of this program.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who, introduced the revised version of the Perkins Act along with Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Glenn Thompson said that he is ""Heartened"" by the Administration's attempt to strengthen apprenticeship programs, although he did not work with the White House on the initiative.

He noted, the President's proposed budget would cut funding for the career, technical and adult education training under the Perkins Act by 13%. If those cuts are implemented, he doesn't think increasing participation from private businesses will close that gap.

""Private companies wont replace federal funding,"" Krishnamoorthi told Fortune.

""All actors have to have skin in the game. It can't be put completely on the backs of small businesses, it has to be something where all the entities share in the burden."""
1882,Staff,6/16/2017 8:22 AM,"President Trump said he will remove federal restrictions and regulations to help companies create more apprenticeships on June 15.

President Trump put a spotlight Thursday on his administration's efforts to broaden the reach of private-sector apprenticeship programs, part of an effort to close a ""Skills gap"" that the White House says is leaving millions of jobs unfilled.

Trump signed an executive order that seeks to reorient and expand ApprenticeshipUSA, a grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration and has been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.

The administration's aim, White House officials say, is to give more flexibility to third parties - including businesses, trade associations and labor unions - to design programs that will offer skills training to those who are seeking jobs for which they are not yet qualified.

Under current rules, the Labor Department is too heavy-handed in crafting the programs, they argue.

""We have regulations upon regulations, and in history nobody has gotten rid of so many regulations as the Trump administration,"" the president said during an event in the Roosevelt Room.

""So we're empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens.""

White House officials said Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump will also use ""The bully pulpit"" that the White House provides to encourage more businesses to create apprenticeship programs.

President Trump thanked his daughter Ivanka for her work promoting apprenticeship programs, and hinted at more progress to come at the White House on June 15.

The administration is seeking to broaden the use of such programs beyond manufacturing to other sectors, including health care and accounting, the official said.

Trump wants to expand the program's budget to about $200 million, roughly twice its existing level, by redirecting other money from the Labor Department, said a White House official, who briefed the media on the condition of anonymity ahead of Trump's announcement.

White House officials say they are seeking bipartisan support for their job-training initiative, a different tack than Trump has used in trying to push through marquee legislation on health care and tax reform.

In his yet-unrealized efforts to revamp the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes, Trump and congressional Republicans are trying to use a parliamentary maneuver that would allow them to pass bills without any Democratic buy-in.

Trump has decried Democrats as ""Obstructionists"" to his initiatives.

Tuesday's announcement drew mixed reactions from Democrats.

Sen. Patty Murray accused the president of trying to ""Paper over"" major cuts he has proposed to existing job training programs.

""Given the Trump administration's history of lining the pockets of corporations and special interests at the expense of workers, it's hard to see this as anything but another thinly veiled broken promise from the president who promised to put workers first, but has failed to do so since day one,"" said Murray, the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

A group of almost two dozen administration officials, governors, lawmakers, dignitaries and apprentices stood behind the president as he spoke.

He met with some of them behind closed doors before signing the executive order.

White House officials were quick to point to the presence of Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott as evidence of their efforts to contact Democrats about the issue.

A half-dozen governors - all Republicans - emerged on the White House grounds to talk to reporters and talk up Trump's efforts.

""We very much appreciate his focus today,"" Said Gov. Scott Walker, who hosted Trump in his state on Tuesday for another event related to workforce development.

Trump's action also drew praise from several industry associations, including the National Restaurant Association.

""The restaurant industry fully supports the president's executive order,"" said Dawn Sweeney, the group's president and chief operating officer, who called apprenticeships ""a proven recognized path to full and rewarding careers.""

Last year, the Obama administration trumpeted its efforts to expand apprenticeship programs, including $90 million secured in the budget for ApprenticeshipUSA through a bipartisan agreement.

""Apprenticeships are among the surest pathways to provide American workers from all backgrounds with the skills and knowledge they need to acquire good-paying jobs and grow the economy,"" the Obama administration said in a news release at the time.

The executive order Trump signed Thursday establishes a task force to recommend ways to promote apprenticeships and directs the Labor Department to evaluate the effectiveness of its various job-training programs.

Trump spent 14 seasons as host of the NBC reality show ""The Apprentice,"" and administration officials have sought to play that down in selling this initiative.

Trump had planned to sign the executive order on apprenticeships during a trip to the Labor Department on Wednesday, but that visit was canceled after a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.."

1887,Journal Star Editorial Board,6/17/2017 8:59 AM,"Donald Trump, pitching the need for apprenticeships?

This week, the president has done serious work to bring his signature proposals - growing the use of apprenticeships for hard-to-fill, technical jobs - closer to reality.

He hit the road and, later, put money where his mouth was to double the funding for a nationwide job-training program.

Trump billed himself as the jobs president on the campaign trail.

In signing an executive order Thursday, he said he wanted to grow and reconfigure the federal ApprenticeshipUSA grant program, which began under his predecessor, President Barack Obama.

Accordingly, White House officials told the Washington Post they're trying to marshal bipartisan support for this initiative.

At a Wisconsin community college Tuesday, Trump spoke glowingly about growing apprenticeships.

His budget proposed cuts to the Department of Labor's federal job training programs by 40 percent, or $1.1 billion.

Two days later, he said he would double the funding - to $200 million - for the grant program by streamlining several federal workforce efforts.

Some Democrats expressed concern over decreased oversight by the Department of Labor.

The administration reported businesses - expected to have a more hands-on role in designing programs - wishing to participate in apprenticeships will need to register with the department, which will still set broad standards.

The math and precise vision for Trump's proposal remain a bit fuzzy in its early days.

What's not is the need for a better system to train workers who can learn to earn in specialized jobs for which businesses have struggled to find qualified candidates amid historically low unemployment.

The Associated Press estimates the U.S. has 6 million open jobs, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports only 4.3 percent unemployment - the lowest figure in a decade - nationwide as of May. Both Nebraska and the Lincoln Metropolitan Area have even less unemployment, per stats released Friday.

All the while, fewer than 500,000 jobs in the entire country - less than half a percent of the nation's 146 million jobs - have been filled by through apprenticeships, according to the AP. Not every position that pays a livable wage requires an advanced degree.

Increasingly, fields such as manufacturing, construction, agriculture, information technology and health care have experienced shortages for specialized positions.

Apprenticeships offer an intriguing means to fill them.

High schools, community colleges, four-year institutions and private industry find themselves at a prime position to team to grow the reach and scope of these ""Learn-to-earn"" opportunities to train and hire candidates for these niche positions.

His actions this week appear to be a first step toward achieving both."
1888,Investor's Business Daily,6/17/2017 9:29 AM,"Jobs: President Trump has signed an executive order that will double the number of apprenticeships in the U.S. by 4.5 million over the next five years.

No corny jokes here about ""The Apprentice"": Trump's move makes enormous sense.

As we're reminded almost daily, America is in the midst of a skills crisis, with many young Americans having worthless college degrees and close to six figures in college debt with few prospects to pay them off.

Today there are a record 6 million jobs unfilled, Labor Department data show, and a good number of those are skilled positions that don't require a college degree but rather, skills and training.

Many young people would have been better served doing a skills- or occupation-based apprenticeship than getting an increasingly worthless college liberal arts degree.

A 2016 Department of Education study looked at employment outcomes of students who pursued an occupational credential or education vs. those who pursued a strictly academic credential at a four-year institution.

What they found was surprising, and completely undercut President Obama's policy of pushing more kids into four-year colleges: A greater share of students with occupational credentials had jobs compared to students with academic credentials.

74% of the occupational students were employed in a job related to what they studied vs. just 53% of college kids with an academic background.

Apprenticeships such as Trump is now promoting are a cost-effective way of melding occupational earning and real-world experience, giving young people a way to build skills that will get them high-paying jobs.

Other nations - most famously, Germany, which has a rich tradition of turning out highly skilled workers - have long embraced the concept.

In Germany, fully two-thirds of those who finish mandatory public schooling enter a paid apprenticeship.

Perhaps not surprisingly, in April Germany had Europe's lowest youth unemployment rate, at 6.8%; in the U.S., by comparison, it was 9.4%. With some 3.7 million mostly-young Americans now in default on their student loans, maybe it's time we admit that not every kid has to go to college.

Apprenticeships will provide America's youth with a way to gain a skill, earn a decent living and join the middle class.

Democrats, instead of pushing a job-killing $15 an hour minimum wage that makes young, unskilled workers all but unemployable, could embrace Trump's apprentice idea.

He's a businessman who understands what's needed to shrink America's skills and earnings gaps."
1889,Robert Lerman,6/18/2017  1:00 PM,"Last week was good for apprenticeships. President Trump?s ringing call for expanding apprenticeship at a White House ceremony on Thursday should be welcome to all who favor a cost-effective approach to upgrading skills, raising job quality and widening routes to rewarding careers.  The president?s first steps to achieve this goal were signing an executive order titled ?Expanding Apprenticeship in America? and nearly doubling the funding for apprenticeships to $200 million.

These actions follow the president?s endorsement last March of a ?moonshot? proposed by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff to create 5 million apprenticeships in five years. Today, 505,000 apprentices are in the registered apprenticeship system: 410,000 in civilian sectors and 95,000 in the military. In addition, an unknown number of apprentices works in companies that have not registered their programs with the state or federal department of labor.  Reaching the 5 million target might sound impractical, but in fact, it would only require that the United States attain about the same share of apprentices in its workforce that Australia and England have already achieved."

Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the Labor Department, has a great saying when it comes to an alleged ""Skills gap"" in the job market: ""If you hear an employer complain they can't find skilled workers, always ask, at what wage?"".

The Business CEO Roundtable has published a report discussing what it says is a shortage of skilled workers in America, and hosted a conference in Washington featuring high profile CEOs, a top aide to Donald Trump and two US senators.

""There are a lot of jobs open,"" said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, during a panel discussion sponsored by the pro-industry lobby.

""There are a lot of people who are not properly trained,"" he maintained.

Is there really a skills shortage? If so, why have median wages been stuck in a rut for so long? Why aren't companies investing more in training and labor-saving equipment? Why aren't they asking workers to work longer hours? It doesn't add up, says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank in Washington.

""We want better educated people but that's not the thing holding back the labor market right now,"" Baker told Business Insider.

""It's an incredible cop out.""

The Business CEO Roundtable event was held as a preview of Trump's ""Workforce development week"" in which he vowed to focused on labor market issues despite sharp proposed budget cuts to training programs.

""Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of a four-year college degree,"" Trump said on June 15 before signing an executive order on apprenticeships.

The Federal Reserve's monthly Beige Book, a report based on conversations between regional Fed officials and businessmen in their districts, tends to perpetuate the notion of a skills gap by unquestioningly regurgitating the complaints of executives.

""Labor markets continued to tighten, with most districts citing shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions,"" said the latest edition, published May 31.

Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, says he is ""Unusually unsympathetic to the evergreen skills gap critique.""

""First the Econ 101 'pay more for more if you want more' cuts against this well in a period of little wage growth,"" Madowitz said.

""Second, there's fascinating/depressing empirical research showing a 'skills gap' occurs because employers add and remove qualifications for the same job postings depending on the labor market, ensuring there is always a skills gap."""

1902,Kalina Newman 3,6/19/2017 3:49 PM,"Donald Trump became a celebrity by hosting a reality show called The Apprentice.

Now he wants to bring apprenticeships to the mainstream.

""We're joined today by apprentices, who know firsthand how these programs can bring new hope and new opportunities."" That's how President Trump opened a speech June 15 where he signed an executive order for the ""Apprenticeship and Workforce of Tomorrow"" program.

""Apprenticeships place students into great jobs, without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees. Instead apprentices earn, while they learn.""

What was that, Mr. Trump? Did we hear you correctly?

""Earn while you learn,"" Trump said again, emphasizing the one thing college students rarely do enough of while they're in class: earning money.

According to the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries, ""An apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and related classroom instruction under the supervision of a journey-level craft person or trade professional in which workers learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a highly skilled occupation.""

In other words, apprenticeships let you develop practical skills while you earn money - on-the-job-training in a specific skill set combined with education.

Apprenticeships are highly structured - apprentices must complete a minimum of 2,000 hours of on-the-job experience and will also take classes, correspondent courses or self-study work.

There are no apprenticeships related to your major if you're majoring in English, history or even STEM. These apprenticeships are meant for those going into skilled trade or labor work, such as auto mechanics or home construction.

Over the past three years, employers have seen a shortage of applicants for trade jobs.

This is now called the ""Skill gap,"" because according to labor market data firm Emsi, 53% of skilled-trade workers in the U.S. are 45 years and older.

Key elements of Trump's Executive Order include providing ""More affordable pathways to secure, high paying jobs by promoting apprenticeships and effective workforce development programs"" and ""Promot[ing] apprenticeships to business leaders across critical industry sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure, cybersecurity, and health care,"" as well as encouraging more apprenticeship programs at colleges and universities.

An apprenticeship may be an attractive option especially if you're interested in possibly pursuing a trade or at least developing a specialized skill set.

There may well be a lot of job growth and opportunity if you go this route, as Trump is currently pushing for 4.5 million new apprenticeships in the next five years.

1913,Staff,6/20/2017 10:54 AM,"The meeting, sponsored by the AFL-CIO Working for American Institute, allowed employers, prospective apprenticeship sponsors and manufacturing industry stakeholders the opportunity to discuss the benefits of developing registered apprenticeship programs that meet present and future workforce needs.

Participants included industrial state labor unions, state and federal labor agencies, training providers and workforce and development advocacy groups.

""Collaboration within government agencies and stakeholders is essential when creating new opportunities and pathways for our citizens to get jobs that pay well and sustain them and their families,"" said Secretary Manderino.

""These connections with other agencies will help the office leverage its resources and expand the footprint of registered apprenticeships across the commonwealth.""

1914,Cassius O. Johnson,6/20/2017 5:54 AM,"Last week, President Trump announced plans for advancing apprenticeships and work-based learning as central strategies for preparing America's work force for the jobs of the future and addressing the skills gap.

Living at the intersection of education and work force development for nearly 35 years, Jobs for the Future agrees that the expansion of earn-and-learn strategies is a legitimate response to the demand from millions in America looking to gain a stronger foothold in the labor market.

That said, the devil is in the details, so we look forward to learning more about this proposal and providing input during the upcoming rule-making process.

At first glance, the initial announcement presents opportunities to deepen collaboration among community colleges, employers, labor, work force boards and other partners in developing high-quality work-based learning programs that prepare workers for the 21st-century economy.

Community colleges should play a vital role in apprenticeship, providing the classroom instruction that complements on-the-job training.

Community colleges' capacity to build work-based learning strategies, in close collaboration with business, has expanded tremendously in recent years, in part due to support from the U.S. Department of Labor's TAACCCT grant program and other public backing to build college-employer partnerships.

These programs emanate from work-based learning elements such as internships and clinical practicums that are embedded in many community college certificate and degree programs.

As noted last week by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, registered apprenticeship programs have resulted in jobs paying an average of $60,000 per year.

Apprenticeships continue to grow in a host of occupations, including traditional sectors such as construction, and are increasing in new ones such as IT, health care and finance.

Students are hired as full-time workers, trained through a combination of hands-on and classroom training, and paid a full-time wage during the period of apprenticeship.

That makes apprenticeship an attractive option for millions of middle- and low-income individuals who must work while seeking to build skills, knowledge and a career.

The Trump plan also seeks to establish ""Industry-recognized apprenticeships that promote the development of apprenticeship programs by third parties [that] may include trade and industry groups, companies, nonprofit organizations, unions, and joint labor-management organizations."" If apprenticeships of the future are to succeed, JFF strongly encourages the administration to not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

As apprenticeships continue to capture the interest of policy makers, employers and career seekers, we acknowledge the registration process should be streamlined to expand development of and access to apprenticeships.

We also urge that the apprenticeship standards be maintained in order to ensure a high baseline of quality, rigor and protections for apprentices, and not confuse or weaken this effective training model.

Specifically, JFF wants to ensure that equal opportunity and diversity continue to be a part of any work-based learning opportunity so that it's truly a pipeline for all workers.

All top-notch apprenticeship offerings should include a portable credential in case a worker wants or needs to work for another employer down the road, so his or her qualifications are intact.

Registered apprenticeships also ensure: alignment with industry standards, the aforementioned equity in access and participation, and the use of data for determining quality - akin to accreditation for higher education programs.

This is why an apprenticeship that is registered is often referred to as the ""Gold standard"" of training programs.

Registration sets high industry standards similar to the much-lauded models in Switzerland and Germany, and it validates an apprentice's knowledge, skills and abilities wherever they go in that industry.

Currently, many workers access work-based learning in college and the workplace.

JFF wants to expand opportunities for young people to engage in high-quality career-focused learning earlier in their lives.

We must ensure that our education systems - K-12 as well as higher education - provide students with a continuum of career awareness, information and exploration opportunities, as well as work-based learning experiences.

When young people participate in such real-world experiences - including pre-apprenticeships, internships, capstone projects and service learning - not only do they transition into postsecondary education with a clearer idea of the careers and relevant programs of study they want to pursue, but they also have higher rates of college completion.

Registered apprenticeships and strong work-based learning initiatives in general are urgently needed for both youths and adults, who greatly benefit when work is combined with classroom training.

We look forward to collaborating with the administration and Congress to ensure the quality and rigor of these programs and to expand and adequately fund all highly effective strategies for preparing America's work force for the future, including those effectively in place as part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act.

With nearly seven million Americans who remain out of work and over 30 million who are without a high school diploma or its equivalent, we must employ the full range of evidence-based work force and education strategies to help all Americans get the skills they need to find family-supporting careers.

This is imperative as the U.S. gap between the skills employers need and those workers have continues to grow.

Community colleges and other postsecondary institutions, working with industry and other partners, can play crucial roles in the expansion of these successful initiatives."

1916,Mark Schneider,6/20/2017 8:34 PM,"Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order to double the amount of funding for apprenticeship programs, up to nearly $200 million.

The goal is, in Trump's words, ""Training people to have great jobs and high-paying jobs."" These goals are also top of mind for young adults: In survey after survey, college students make it clear that they are seeking higher wages and better career prospects in return for their investment.

Historically, America has emphasized the production of bachelor's degrees as the means by which young people can reach these goals.

On average, bachelor's-degree holders enjoy substantial lifetime returns over those of high-school graduates.

Many colleges do not equip graduates with the skills required for labor-market success.

In turn, employers bemoan their inability to find students with necessary skills, and graduates face underemployment and lower-than-expected earnings.

In short, this bachelor's-or-bust approach is not working for students or employers.

Mark Schneider is the president of College Measures.

The problem is that the bachelor's degree has become the ultimate end of higher education, at the expense of students' rationale for seeking an education: a good job and a steady wage.

Instead, if we prioritized teaching marketable skills rather than producing degrees, then an assortment of pathways would naturally emerge that lead students to their desired outcomes.

These options could be faster and cheaper than four-year programs, with better outcomes to boot.

One that has received a lot of recent attention is ""Coding boot camps"" like General Assembly, The Iron Yard, and Galvanize.

Students spend three to six months in intensive coding programs, in lieu of four or more years for a B.S. in computer science.

Boot camps often boast high salaries and near-perfect placement rates, a function of their ties to employers in cutting-edge fields.

Apprenticeships also offer work-centric instruction with excellent employment opportunities and solid wages.

Despite both the Obama and Trump administrations praising these programs, apprenticeships are still a road less traveled.

According to Department of Labor statistics, apprenticeship programs graduated only around 50,000 apprentices in 2016, compared to 2 million bachelor's degrees granted the same year.

What might explain these programs' lack of growth? Apprenticeships have been around for ages but are often viewed as viable for a small slice of students.

This stems partly from the perception that apprenticeships are ""Blue collar"" or for those who aren't ""College material."" The belief that apprenticeships are heavily controlled by labor unions and lead only to jobs in construction has also hampered growth.

In most states, there's a dearth of data on how apprentices fare in the work force.

Florida tracks the median first-year wages and employment rates for 12 apprenticeship programs offered by ""District technical centers,"" a key component of its post-secondary education system.

These programs range from plumbing technology to machining to early childhood education, and most of them result in median first-year wages between $40,000 and $55,000, compared to only $34,000 for bachelor's-degree holders.

The most lucrative program, for elevator constructor mechanics, boasts median first-year wages of $91,000.

Employment rates also favor apprenticeship graduates, with all but one program reporting a rate of 83 percent or higher, compared to 71 percent for bachelor's-degree programs.

Yes, federal data show that wages of bachelor's-degree recipients grow at a faster rate than those of students completing apprenticeships.

That means, over time, the wage gap between four-year graduates and apprentices will narrow and potentially reverse.

Many graduates of apprenticeship programs are solidly in the middle class, making family-sustaining wages.

Importantly, many of them might have had difficulty completing the classroom-focused instruction that's required for a bachelor's degree.

While we praise coding boot camps that train students to fill a need in our increasingly technological economy, we should also laud apprenticeship programs that train students to fix the plumbing, air conditioning, electrical systems, and elevators that make boot camps - and almost everything else in our society - function.

We need to collect and disseminate more data to inform young adults about apprenticeship opportunities, helping to spread the model to more students and develop programs covering more career options.

1923,Ashley Haynes - Freeman,6/21/2017 10:19 AM,"Waukesha County Automation Systems Technology students use robots in the Generac Lab in the colleges Integrated Manufacturing Center.

PEWAUKEE - The Department of Workforce Development highlighted the launch of a new Mechatronics Technician Registered Apprenticeship program for Wisconsin manufacturers during an information session on Monday at the Waukesha County Technical College Generac Integrated Manufacturing Lab.

The Generac Lab is part of the Integrated Manufacturing Center and opened in January 2016.

The building is used to support the automation system technology program, the industrial maintenance technology program, and the engineering and electrical apprenticeship programs.

""We wanted to get all those programs that interact so much in the real world all into one building,"" said Mike Shiels, dean of WCTC'S School of Applied Technologies.

Shiels hopes that the new mechatronics apprenticeship program will start in the fall with around 12 students.

Companies will identify employees that they believe are skilled enough to advance to a higher skill level.

These employees will earn their paychecks, credentials as journeyworkers and more training through the program.

""It's a great workforce development tool,"" said Shiels.

""It's really advancing the skill set of the employees at the company. They're investing in both the company's and the employee's futures.""

The DWD's Bureau of Apprenticeship Standards sought to address the skills gap and training needs in advanced manufacturing by developing the Mechatronics Technician Registered Apprenticeship.

""Manufacturing is ever evolving with technical complexity that requires our technicians to understand mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, computer and control engineering,"" said Jeff Clark, president and CEO of Waukesha Metal Products.

Mechatronics technicians support robotics and automation technologies used in modern manufacturing processes for electrical, mechanical and electronic systems.

Workers typically troubleshoot, operate and debug industrial computer and communications systems.

These highly skilled technicians may machine metal and other materials, fabricate parts and weld components.

At some companies, they also work in collaborative environments documenting work performed while supporting facilities, utilities and grounds.

""The ability to troubleshoot systems involved in manufacturing and process control is critical for this occupation,"" said Shiels.

Within the Integrated Manufacturing Center, there are state-of-the-art tools that allow students and workers to learn with ease.

The actual Generac Lab houses 16 robots and other high-tech automation.

There is also a manufacturing cell within the lab, a CNC machine fully integrated with a robot, and robotic welders.

Mechatronics Technician Registered Apprenticeship training is a 5-year program of no less than 10,000 hours, including 864 hours of related technical instruction available at WCTC and other Wisconsin technical colleges across the state starting this fall.

Apprentices who successfully complete training hours and competency requirements will earn a nationally recognized industry credential and technical college credits that may be applied towards an associate's degree."

And thanks to SLATE, I?m in,? St. Louis resident Nathaniel Jackson said.

Jackson is taking part in Explore St. Louis? Entertainment Apprenticeship Program.

1925,Staff Report,6/21/2017 12:00 PM,"Of the challenges today?s pool and spa professionals face, the biggest may be hiring (and keeping) qualified employees. Tim Coleman, managing partner of Augusta Aquatics (Fishersville, Va.), knows firsthand. After years of trying online job listings, he decided to take a stand and try solving the problem himself.  ?Online resources like Indeed, Craigslist, Monster and Facebook posts have produced lackluster results over the past few years,? Coleman says. ?My high school motto was, ?Find a way or make one,? and that is our latest approach. If we cannot find experienced, well-trained individuals, we will create them.?

The result is the Construction Technician Apprenticeship Program, which blends syllabi from existing industry courses, like those from APSP and Genesis, and compiles them into a single, two-year or 160-credit-hour apprenticeship. The final syllabus was approved by the state of Virginia.  ?I think it?s going to be beneficial for our trade as a whole, especially with the licensing movement that we?re seeing, to have people formally trained,?

1926,Lance Lambert,6/21/2017 12:40 PM,"As an electronics installer, he wasn't going to make a lot of money.

In 2009, the 37-year-old Mississippian took an electrician apprenticeship administered by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the New Deal agency envisioned in 1933 by then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as ""a corporation clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise."" Instead of paying for college, Brown got paid, all the while learning the trade over five years.

""We do the book work, but the on-the-job training and experience, there is no way to put value on it,"" Brown said.

TVA lineman apprenticeships start at around $40,000 a year and rise to $65,000.

At the end of the program, a lineman can earn more than $75,000-and more than $90,000 if he or she makes foreman, as Brown did.

Could apprenticeships be part of the answer to the infamous U.S. skills gap? They would certainly be a useful alternative to college for some Americans graduating heavily in debt and into an economy for which they are unprepared.

Employers have complained for years that the nation doesn't have enough skilled workers to fill the jobs of an increasingly technical workforce.

House Speaker Paul Ryan urged members of the National Association of Manufacturers to mind the gap in a speech Tuesday.

Last Thursday, President Donald Trump, who sees hands-on career training as a solution, signed an executive order to spur apprenticeships.

""Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees. Instead, apprentices earn while they learn,"" Trump said at the signing ceremony, flanked by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, both Republicans.

Back in March, during a roundtable discussion on vocational training, Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, issued a challenge to the president.

""I see a great opportunity right here in the United States to create apprenticeships. And we'd love to encourage you to take a moon shot goal to create five million apprenticeships in the next five years,"" Benioff said.

""Let's go for that five million.""

The problem is, there are only 505,000 apprentices in the U.S. today, according to the Department of Labor, and the total has been growing by an average of 43,000 a year since 2013, a rate far short of what would be needed to reach five million by 2022.

""We don't have the institutional setup to do this,"" said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, who called the president's goal ""Trumped up.""

Asked about Trump's ambitions for apprenticeships, the White House noted that the president made no mention of the five million goal in the executive order or in his remarks at the signing ceremony, and said that Trump has proposed doubling federal spending on the Apprenticeship USA program, to $200 million a year, and aims to simplify the registration process.

Currently in the U.S., an employer sponsors and pays an apprentice in line with standards set by the Department of Labor or state agencies.

The government would need to make far more resources available to meet the president's goal, said Robert Lerman, a fellow at the Urban Institute.

""I can't see in four or five years,"" Lerman said.

""But it could be in 10 years, if done right.""

In the U.S., where apprenticeships are concentrated in electrician, plumbing, carpentry and construction jobs, they would need to be available in more industries and occupations, he said.

Moving more career routes into the apprenticeship model would take a massive overhaul in hiring practices and many years to implement.

Trump's plan appears to depend partly on a broadening clause in the executive order that allows many existing internships to be categorized as apprenticeships, Carnevale said.

Increasing apprenticeships would take a big financial commitment from employers, too.

Siemens AG estimates that its U.S. apprenticeship program, founded in 2011, costs the company around $187,000 a student.

The company partners with local higher education institutions.

After completion of the four-year program, graduates leave with an associate degree and a job at Siemens, signing contracts for two years of service.

""I think it would be wonderful to have more apprenticeships. It would definitely help our workforce,"" Brown, the newly minted Mississippi electrician, said.

""Skilled labor is the way to go."""
1930,Staff Report,6/22/2017  11:00 AM,"There is a distinct difference between a job training program and an apprenticeship, and leaders in the labor movement are spreading this message.  ?Apprenticeships are comprehensive experiences, where individuals not only learn a skill, they practice and develop that skill in conjunction with the needs of the business community, while earning a fair, living wage,? said Pennsylvania AFL-CIO President Rick Bloomingdale. ?Any job training program that does not involve businesses and industry, a decent living and solid instruction, fails in comparison. Highly skilled manufacturing jobs are the future, and apprenticeship programs are an essential part of filling those jobs.?

Representatives from industrial labor unions, manufacturing employers, state labor federations, state and federal labor agencies, and education and workforce and development advocacy groups met earlier this week in Oakwood, Pennsylvania, to discuss state and national efforts to bolster apprenticeship programs.  Apprenticeship training programs mean working people who participate in them learn the latest technologies and skills, and also learn how to stay safe on the job. ?Embracing and developing these training programs will modernize systems and procedures to improve productivity and safety,? said Ohio AFL-CIO President Tim Burga.  "
1932,Stephon Johnson,6/22/2017  11:35 AM,"Last week in Wisconsin, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that he said would allow industries to create more apprenticeship programs.  Trump?s plan for the program will allegedly cost $200 million and take some power away from the Department of Labor. The Trump administration wants to fill the 6 million vacant jobs in the United Stated that are vacant because the labor force does not have the required skills for these positions.  ?We will be removing federal restrictions that have prevented many different industries from creating apprenticeship programs,? said Trump before signing the executive order. ?We have regulations on top of regulations. And in history, nobody has gotten rid of so many regulations as the Trump administration. And that?s one of the reasons that you see the jobs and the companies all kicking in so strongly. I think some very good numbers are going to be announced, by the way, in the very near future as to GDP.

?So we?re empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens,? Trump continued. ?Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees. Instead, apprentices earn while they learn?which is an expression we?re using: Earn while you learn.?  But some unions, such as the American Federation of Teachers, reminded the public that Trump?s federal budget plan would cut funding for worker training by 40 percent (from $2.7 billion to $1.6 billion).

In 1940, the work rate was 86.4%, which was near the end of the Great Depression. To make matters worse, approximately 7 million men between the ages of 25?54 are not even looking for a job today. But men are not the only ones feeling the pinch of the labor market. A Council of Economic Advisers report indicated the job participation rate was 75% for prime-age women in 2015. A more depressing story arises when you disaggregate data by race or education attainment."
1945,Mark Muro,6/23/2017 7:37 PM,"President Donald Trump's embrace of apprenticeships as an effective way to train workers for meaningful, middle-skill careers offered a break last week from the Trump administration's near-total indifference to serious policy development.

For once, Trump carried out a relatively normal policy announcement, complete with a relatively cogent speech.

Trump focused on a topic of both genuine relevance and bipartisan appeal.

What is more, the president managed to get the big things right with his executive order.

In noting that a four-year college degree isn't for everyone, he spoke reasonably about the potential of paid, hands-on workplace experiences that train workers and link them to employers.

Trump rightly underscored the need for industry - rather than the government - to play the largest role in structuring those experiences.

While some are criticizing that emphasis, it's actually the right one.

The executive order is welcome not only because it seeks to build on - rather than trash - ApprenticeshipsUSA, a popular grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration.

Equally important, Trump's move to reorient and grow the program seems to reflect a constructive bid to enhance the effectiveness and reach of the nation's main apprenticeship program by nudging it into closer alignment with the private sector.

The executive order seeks to build on ApprenticeshipsUSA, a popular grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration.

Industry influence is not always desirable, to be sure, especially given the Trump administration's excessive coziness with powerful interest groups in the oil, gas and financial sectors.

In the case of workforce training, a high degree of coordination with industry - ideally on everything from program design to curriculum, certifications and job placement - is now seen by most stakeholders as a crucial dividing line between programs that work and programs that don't.

Such alignment  and ideally co-development  of programs with the private sector serves as a strong check on the biggest problem of American workforce training: training divorced from market demand.

So Trump's moves to encourage the establishment of more ""Industry-recognized"" - as opposed to ""Government-registered"" - apprenticeships are actually the most welcome element of the new executive order, after the doubling of the program's budget to $200 million.

Trump-weary critics are wary of the order's plan to give more flexibility to ""Third parties"" - including companies, trade associations and unions - to design new apprenticeship programs.

The order's flexibility represents a needed reduction of overly rigid regulations, even as it responsibly tasks the secretary of labor to establish a new review process for maintaining the quality of both the existing government-registered and the new industry-certified apprenticeships.

The order represents a welcome encouragement to employers to embrace apprenticeships as an effective way to recruit and train workers.

Now of course, there are some problems here  the usual Trump flimflammery.

For one thing, last week's announcement follows Trump's endorsement of Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's ""Moonshot"" challenge to Trump to create 5 million apprenticeships in five years  but the numbers don't add up.

Specifically, Trump proposes to multiply the nation's 500,000 registered apprenticeships by a factor of 10 but appears committed to only doubling the program's $90 million budget.

In similar fashion, the new expansion of apprenticeship comes against the backdrop of draconian cuts to the entire workforce development budget.

In this regard, the president's budget proposal for 2018 calls for slashing the Labor Department's budget to $9.6 billion, a reduction of about 21 percent.

Development of programs with the private sector serves as a strong check on the biggest problem of American workforce training: training divorced from market demand.

In the same vein, there is Trump's focus on apprenticeships to the exclusion of all else in the workforce development realm.

While the creation of 5 million apprenticeships would be a worthy strike against the nation's alleged ""Skills gaps,"" apprenticeships won't solve the nation's other large labor market problems.

Apprenticeships won't by themselves address the ""Hollowing out"" of the middle of the market as technology substitutes for routine-based tasks, for example.

Nor will expanding apprenticeships do much to address the problem of skill obsolescence in a changing economy, when many employers may prefer to return to the entry-level market rather than retrain their existing workforce.

Neither, for that matter, will apprenticeships help much with addressing the increasing numbers of prime-age workers who choose not to participate in the labor force at all.

With that said, Trump's initiative to expand apprenticeships by allowing new actors to develop standards for a new crop of industry-recognized apprenticeships to complement the existing ones is - at least in concept - an incremental but genuine advance.

For once, a reckless president has brought forth a constructive plan for supporting a beneficial development in the economy."
1949,Sam Becker,6/25/2017 2:00 PM,"Even if you disagree with President Donald Trump and his administration, there are some positive kernels out there. Trump has put an emphasis on jobs, for example, specifically jobs for the struggling middle and lower class. Although those promised jobs might not necessarily come to fruition, it?s good to hear somebody at least talk about blue-collar struggles.  One way the president is focusing on jobs is by attempting to bring back apprenticeships. Apprenticeships, of course, are on-the-job training programs that used to be quite popular but have fizzled out with time. There are still plenty of them out there, but most young people these days seem much more focused on a earning a college degree than completing an apprenticeship.

Trump recently signed an executive order to push for more apprenticeships in both the public and private sectors. The order will double the $200 million in taxpayer money that goes toward job-training programs. There are around 500,000 apprenticeship openings across the country, and many of them will lead to secure, high-paying careers.  We just need to persuade people to sign up. The issue, of course, is there are still millions of people who are out of work. Even though we have record-high job openings, people are still clinging to the economic edge. Trump?s plan is one way in which the government hopes to remedy that."
1951,Cheryl Olson,6/26/2017  12:00 PM,"Significant talent shortages and skill gaps are slowing employers' efforts to expand, innovate, and excel. These workforce challenges undermine productivity and profitability.  The good news? There is a program solution to meet talent challenges: Registered Apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are experiencing a resurgence as the preferred ""earn and learn"" model of employment across the country. They have been utilized to meet the needs of America's skilled workforce for over 75 years but many think of traditional trades such as construction, electrician and plumber as the ideal occupations for apprenticeship.

The Hawaii Cook Apprenticeship program will give culinary training to current employees of local restaurants and food service establishments, aiming to build and retain local talent.

Apprentices will be paid a progressively increasing schedule of wages during their apprenticeship, and upon completion, will receive a certification equivalent to 14 credits, which is considered a full semester that would cost a Hawaii resident $1,794 and a non-resident $4,790.  ""The win for the employer is the fact you are getting trained cooks without having to pay for that training,"" Ron Takahashi, chair of KCC's culinary arts program, said.  ""For the employee the win is you're going to get a high-end education of the same quality of our credit program, which is nationally renowned."""
1966,Abigail Summerville,6/27/2017 9:37 AM,"When President Donald Trump hosted the TV show ""The Apprentice,"" only one lucky contestant received a job at the end of each season.

Under his recently proposed apprenticeship program, the goal is to employ 5 million Americans.

Apprenticeships hold some appeal for families anticipating the sticker shock of a college education, which is currently around $33,480 at private colleges and $24,930 at public colleges for the 2016-2017 school year, according to the College Board.

In an apprenticeship program, a company generally trains a student in one skill for a specific field.

That often leads to a job right after training, sidestepping the traditional college path - and tuition expenses.

Experts say even though apprenticeships are hot, the trend shouldn't change the way you plan and save for your child's college education."

1973,Joshua D. Hawley,6/29/2017  2:00 PM,"Apprenticeships are all the rage. President Trump recently announced a doubling of federal funding for apprenticeship programs to $200 million in his next budget. This follows an investment by President Obama of $50 million in the outgoing months of his administration. In fact, this follows a major rewrite of the federal legislation governing job training in 2014. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) calls for a much greater level of coordination among workforce programs.

President Trump correctly noted that the organizational framework surrounding workforce development still needs some work, but this criticism is too simplistic. States have made major strides in recent years to improve the coordination of workforce development, and some have promoted apprenticeships as a part of the effort. The WIOA legislation made a requirement for workforce plans at the state level and some states have plans to expand apprenticeships. Many states have invested state tax revenue in apprenticeships and other mechanisms to strengthen training for youth."

1977,Melissa Young,6/29/2017 4:12 PM,"For some, the recent unveiling of President Trump's Executive Order pledging to expand apprenticeships nationwide - programs that allow workers to ""Earn and learn"" on the job - was a welcome action in keeping with his campaign promise to get millions of Americans back to work.

The EO itself and this administration's actions so far are in direct conflict with the goal of expanding these programs.

They fail to dismantle the historic and current inequities that prevent access to apprenticeship programs for millions of individuals.

Supporting pathways to employment and good jobs for every American who wants to work is win-win for individuals, families, businesses, communities and the entire nation.

Doing so requires resolve among a myriad of stakeholders, including the federal government, to uphold a commitment to equitable access to employment and programs that support career pathways.

Apprenticeship programs are often inaccessible for low-income individuals, women, individuals of color and those facing barriers to employment who would benefit the most from the opportunity to increase skills and income.

Only 2.1 percent of apprenticeships were held by women in 2013.

Analysis by the U.S. Department of Labor shows that apprenticeship programs are often less diverse than the occupations they ultimately serve.

More often than not, women and people of color are overrepresented in the lowest-paying apprenticeship programs.

There could be several factors that contribute to inequitable access to apprenticeship programs - and there are a range of solutions.

Workers facing barriers to employment may lack the needed skills to enter apprenticeship programs and could benefit from pre-apprenticeship programs that offer adult basic education and training.

For workers with a spotty work history, pathways into apprenticeships through subsidized employment may be valuable, like those programs found in Chicago and elsewhere.

For workers who are juggling the multiple demands of family and work obligations, robust support services like affordable child care or transportation may make participating in apprenticeship programs feasible.

More insidious is that discrimination contributes significantly to inequities faced by workers of color and women attempting to access apprenticeship programs which requires upholding and enforcing affirmative action plans in apprenticeship program recruitment, training and hiring practices.

The paradox of President Trump's Executive Order is that the EO language and this administration's actions are in direct conflict with the goal of expanding apprenticeship programs.

First, the EO itself does not include any guarantee that the new ""Industry-recognized"" apprenticeships will uphold the current job quality and equal opportunity standards for the program.

Trump's overall commitment to reducing government regulation calls into question the degree to which current, much less expanded, apprenticeship programs will be held accountable to equitable recruitment, training and hiring practices.

Trump's FY18 budget proposal calls for gutting funding for workforce and education programs and a myriad of other supports that directly benefit and contribute to the success of the very same workers who are often denied access to apprenticeship programs.

Will President Trump's apprenticeship pledge benefit those who could benefit the most? The reality is that his actions and those of this administration will ultimately speak louder than words on a page."

More than 1,000 employees are enrolled in the Broadband Apprenticeship Program across Charter systems.

Missouri, where the initiative's expansion was announced last week, represents one of the states where the training already runs.

Connecticut would comprise one of the program's new states.

The program includes classroom, online and on-the-job training for technicians as they progress in their careers at Charter.

Veterans discharged during the past 10 years who participate in the program can receive GI Bill benefits.

Training focuses on several areas related to a technician's daily work: customer service, safety and the skills required to perform installations and service calls.

Upon completion, technicians are awarded national certification through the U.S. Department of Labor.

Charter is working to gain recertification for the program from the federal Labor Department to cover the 41-state service network created following Charter's May 2016 acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.

The company employs more than 11,500 veterans, compared with a total workforce of more than 92,000.

Company officials also positioned the program's growth as supporting plans to hire 20,000 employees during the next four years as the company returns former Time Warner Cable call center jobs from overseas to the U.S. In 2016, veterans comprised some 10.6 million members of the nation's workforce, representing about 7 percent of the total.

Connecticut's working population included about 104,000 veterans, about 6 percent of the overall contingent.

The national veteran unemployment rate totaled 4.3 percent in 2016, compared with an overall national average of 4.9 percent.

Connecticut recorded last year a 4.4 percent veteran unemployment rate last year, compared with an overall state average of 5.1 percent."

1988,Staff Report,6/6/2017  3:00 AM,"""Noel Ginsburg, chief executive of a plastics company, spent years pouring money into college scholarships, trying to entice dozens of high-school students to graduate and to pursue four years of college.

""Now he wonders whether the promise of college was ever enough, since most kids never make it to a four-year institution anyway.""  ""'We were wrong,' he says, in an interview at Intertech Plastics, a warehouse facility here on Interstate 70. 'It should have been college and career.

For the students who don?t go to four-year colleges, what?s the implied message? 'You?re a loser,' he says.

If CareerWise meets its goals, 20,000 Colorado students will be enrolled in apprenticeship programs by 2027.  Apprenticeships ? long embraced as a work-force-training method in other countries ? may now have an opening to become a far more common pathway to education and employment in the United States.

1989,PR Newswire,6/6/2017  5:15 PM,"Phaze Concrete was founded in 2003 by a team of industrious men. They started with small projects in Nevada and Utah, working on residential properties and pouring driveways. The men quickly became successful because of their cooperation and hard work, and because they ensured that all of their customers were contented and happy. Slowly but surely, the company started to grow. Gradually, their work on residential properties was replaced with those for large commercial properties, such as parking garages and even Walmart stores. And their services were no longer just for Nevada and Utah, but rather for all of the Western states.  It should be noted that what never changed was the company's focus on teamwork and performance. This was what actually caused them to be chosen to work on the Family Dollar distribution center, measuring a million square feet. They even earned the ACI Intermountain chapter award of excellence in flatwork and tilt-up concrete for this work. Today, the company has some 250 staff members and they are able to work on projects in concrete, utilities, and earthwork all over the Western states. Their crew members focus on completing jobs ahead of schedule and within budget.

The company has always been committed to continuously improving the quality of their work and to increasing efficiency. To achieve this, they ensure that all employees work together as part of a team so that everyone is committed to creating a safe, professional, and pleasant atmosphere where everybody wants to work. Phaze Concrete has always ensured that they are committed to the safety of their employees. Their Experience Modification (EMOD) rating currently stands at 0.72%, which truly shows this commitment.  Furthermore, in 2016, the company joined forces with the Department of Labor's Department of Apprenticeships, creating an exciting and completely unique work education program.

As part of these cuts, the Administration aims to all but wipe out the Women?s Bureau ? the sole federal agency charged with advocating for working women and for the economic security of women and their families.  Despite singing its praises in a blog published yesterday celebrating the Women?s Bureau?s 97th anniversary, the Administration is calling for a 75 percent cut to the Bureau?s budget, from $11.5M down to just under three, including a complete dismantling of all 10 of its regional offices. In his budget statement, Secretary Acosta also unilaterally reduces the Bureau?s mission from a duty to formulate standards and policies that promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment to a mere research function.

While the Women?s Bureau?s line item constitutes less than one percent of the Department?s total budget, its impact for working women has been enormous. This small agency has worked on high priority policy issues such as paid leave and earned sick time, as well as highlighting the needs of women veterans and women in the trades. The Women?s Bureau has been at the forefront of addressing equal pay and ensuring breastfeeding and pregnancy accommodations. Issues that the Bureau once raised as ?women?s issues? have become the standard for all workers today.

1997,Todd Thibodeaux,6/7/2017  8:14 AM,"Despite bitter partisanship in Washington, shoring up the country?s cybersecurity defenses is a critical priority on which both Democrats and Republicans agree.  Last December, the Obama administration released a report with a number of recommendations to protect the country, including launching a national cybersecurity apprenticeship program and renewing focus on protecting critical infrastructure. The Trump administration has largely continued his predecessor?s cybersecurity initiative, signing an executive order that highlights many of the same topics. Several cabinet members have been tasked with assessing the scope and sufficiency of existing cybersecurity apprenticeship programs and infrastructure security, hinting at future support.  But the business community doesn?t need to wait for Washington. Apprenticeships are already proving to be a valuable tool to close the cybersecurity skills gap.

Organizations understandably focus on hiring cybersecurity experts who have the experience and skills to fit their needs. But this exclusive emphasis on the end of the talent pipeline is self-defeating. Without taking a proactive stance to develop more talent, a business?s ability to hire qualified cybersecurity experts is at the mercy of market forces. Employers must move beyond attracting existing cybersecurity professionals and take a role in training them.  Apprentices should be viewed as future employees who already bring a knowledge of your organization?s environment, processes and vulnerabilities to the table, valuable assets that a more experienced outsider would lack. Apprenticeships are not a short-term solution to an immediate need, but as a deliberate, long-game approach to ensuring a reliable talent pipeline."

Eleven of the recipients are in southeastern Wisconsin, accounting for $1.03 million in funding and 1,150 apprenticeships.

The largest recipients in the area include the Waukesha County School-to-Work Partnership, receiving $242,100 for 269 students; Milwaukee Public Schools, receiving $225,000 for 250 students; GPS Education Partners, receiving $205,200 for 228 students; and Sheboygan Area, receiving $107,880 for 120 students.

2008,Molly Wood And Clare Toeniskoetter,6/8/2017 1:08 PM,"You've probably heard by now: the tech industry is in need of talent.

Some companies are looking to veterans of the military to fill those roles.

Amazon has partnered with the Department of Labor, creating the Amazon Veterans Apprenticeship Program.

Veterans enrolled in the 16-week program train for positions in cloud computing.

Ardine Williams is vice president of talent acquisition for Amazon Web Services, and she's also a veteran herself.

Williams spoke with Marketplace's Molly Wood about the difficulties of finding a civilian job, and Amazon's efforts to help.

Ardine Williams: The challenge that people have on the tech side is, in many cases, the technology that they've been working with doesn't change as quickly in the military as it does in the civilian sector, and so helping veterans who are a good fit culturally and have good basic technical skills learn that next, more state of the art capability is really what helps bridge them into a role in tech, and then open up other career opportunities.

Related In Los Angeles, progress in getting vets into housing Workers who provide services to veterans and their families just took a pay cut The difficulties with veteran retention.

Molly Wood: What other things about the transition might be hard for veterans coming into the private sector, Amazon in particular?

Williams: You have to be willing to take a stand and say this is what I want to do.

We have thousands of job openings at Amazon and I get contacted regularly by veterans who say ""I'm really a capable leader and I can do just about anything."" And I don't have any jobs like that.

I need someone to come and say ""Hey, these are three jobs that are a great fit for me"" and ""I want to be a project manager in supply chain."" It's a very different experience in the military where you have a branch officer or someone the career side saying, ""Hey Ardine, we're going to send you to Fort X and you're going to do Y."".

Wood: The tech industry takes a lot of criticism for being in a bubble in a lot of ways.

Do you think that hiring from the military, creating a pathway for veterans, could improve the sort of pipeline problem that the tech industry often cites in terms of improving diversity? Or is the military its own bubble?

Williams: While it's imperfect, the military is a relatively good snapshot demographically of the U.S., not geographically perfect, but from a demographic perspective if you look at gender and ethnicity.

So in that regard, it's a very valuable pipeline for any industry.

Williams: The first piece for me is ""Are they successful, are we actually able to bring people in?"" and then, ""Can we scale it, can I grow it to be a very robust pipeline?"" So late last year, we worked with the Department of Labor to build an apprenticeship program and we're running a number of cohorts this year in different locations.

Success to me will be that we have a great graduation rate from those programs and that those graduates go on to roles that continue to increase in responsibility at Amazon.

2009,Editor,6/8/2017 4:17 PM,"As Baby Boomers working in manufacturing are reaching retiring age and will leave the workforce by 2030, they are taking their skills and knowledge with them due to the shortage of qualified young individuals to replace them.

While the manufacturing industry in the U.S. has traditionally accounted for a significant portion of the national economic output, employers are struggling to find qualified talent despite the economic climate.

This College heard the concerns of local employers and has developed a solution to help sustain a quality workforce.

Through its Apprenticeship Programs, Harper College partners with employers to train and educate students so they gain the skills and knowledge to successfully begin their careers in a variety of industries.

As the only Community College sponsored Registered Apprenticeship program in the state of Illinois through the U.S. Department of Labor, Harper College combines job related credit courses with structured on-the-job learning experiences providing workers with advanced skill sets meeting the specific needs of employers.

Harper is developing additional programs based on employer needs, and will even work with employers in the area to develop a program to meet its needs."
2012,Trey Mewes Tmewes@mankatofreepress.com,6/9/2017 7:11 AM,"MANKATO - If lawmakers want to help grow jobs, they need to support regional efforts to attract more people and help fix quality of life issues.

That's what area business and education leaders told U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar's staff Thursday afternoon.

Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, has had her staff tour the state this week to discuss local initiatives to get more people working in advance of a looming statewide workforce shortage of tens of thousands of people over the next five years.

""This is important policy for everyone,"" Klobuchar said in a video statement.

Klobuchar has worked on various legislation over the past few years to promote apprenticeship opportunities for skilled and technical labor workers.

The senator secured a $5 million grant from the Department of Labor in 2015 that helped create the Minnesota Apprenticeship Initiative, which supporters say helps bridge the gap between colleges and businesses.

South Central College has built several apprenticeship and internship programs in the area through business partnerships.

Though apprenticeships are popular in Europe, U.S. businesses have moved away from those types of programs over the past few decades.

College officials say more federal support is needed to grow apprenticeship opportunities for students.

""We've kind of left that maybe in the '80s or the '90s as a country, and we're struggling because of it,"" said SCC President Annette Parker.

Mankato business experts say the biggest hindrance to the region's job growth is attracting people.

Last year, Greater Mankato Growth found the Mankato area will need almost 2,800 new workers by 2020 to cover projected job openings.

That's an uphill climb for almost every growing regional center in the state, according to GMG President and CEO Jonathan Zierdt.

The Mankato area is looking to draw in new workers by highlighting the area's quality of life and find better ways to connect workers with employers.

GMG recently unveiled an online jobs and internships portal, greatermankatojobs.com, but are looking into other opportunities to hook potential new residents.

GMG is working with local businesses to create Kato X, a virtual tours website that would highlight local sights and activities as a way to market the Mankato area.

People could visit the area in virtual reality to experience the region's outdoor attractions while businesses could market themselves in subtle ways.

""Maybe you're an outdoor person,"" Zierdt said.

""If I could give you an experience in three minutes what it's like to kayak down the Blue Earth River, I might bring you and your entire family here pretty fast.""

Businesses also need to offer more benefits to workers to attract them, from better medical care packages to help with student loans.

Zierdt said some area businesses are looking at offering to pay a majority of an employee's student loan debt but could need state and federal help to ensure those payments aren't taxable income.

The demand for workers is especially crucial for smaller communities in rural Minnesota, which lose some of their workforce to larger cities like Mankato.

""Everybody's been trying to recruit in your neighborhood,"" said Tami Murphy of Windings Manufacturing Inc. in New Ulm.

""Taking workers from each other is not going to solve the situation that we're in.""

Transportation, housing and day care needs are large roadblocks for workers and a difficult barrier for employers to retain their staff.

Economic experts in southern Minnesota have sought a slight decrease in daycare license standards to encourage more child care businesses, which could help fix a day care shortage across the state.

In some cases, employers are offering child care and housing opportunities as part of job offerings to workers.

""It's just the way it has to be now,"" Murphy said.

Minnesota's immigrants have been held up as a potential solution to an upcoming statewide workforce shortage, but experts say not enough has been done to reach out to immigrant communities.

Brent Pearson, project manager for the Region Nine Economic Development Commission, highlighted the fact there are few immigrant or refugee headhunters or advisers who can connect workers to area jobs.

Language barriers and transferable credits for highly educated foreign workers prove to be additional barriers for those workers.

If the state wants to help connect immigrants to jobs, they'll need to make more outreach efforts.

""I can't tell you how many economic development meetings I've sat in where people have said we have an impending workforce shortage, we need 3,000 workers, and we're looking at this immigrant population to fill that,"" Pearson said."
2013,Deidre Williams,6/9/2017 8:33 AM,"Mayor Byron W. Brown announced a community workforce agreement for the Northland Corridor Redevelopment project to transform the 35-acre site into an industrial hub for business and a state workforce training center.

The project labor agreement between the Buffalo Urban Development Corporation and the Buffalo Building and Construction Trades Council sets goals for the employment of 25 percent minorities, 5 percent women, 30 percent city residents and 20 percent apprentice hours.

It also guarantees entry of up to 20 individuals from the project's ZIP code of 14215 and surrounding ZIP codes into the Buffalo Building Trades Pre-Apprenticeship Program, which is an eight-week paid training program.

Brown made the announcement Thursday at the Northland site and was joined by representatives from BUDC, members of the trades council and members of the Concerned Clergy of Western New York."
2014,Staff Report,7/1/2017 1:00 AM,"Gov. Matt Bevin and Labor Deputy Secretary Mike Nemes joined officials from Norton Healthcare in Louisville this week to announce a new apprenticeship for nurses that is one of the first of its kind in the country.  This Student Nurse Apprenticeship Program is a paid apprenticeship that provides educational and clinical experiences over 12 to 18 months to prepare students for a registered nurse role after graduation. Eligible students include nurses who are in their junior year of a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing program or with one semester completed of an associate degree in nursing program.

?Innovative training programs, like this one at Norton Healthcare, deserve to be celebrated,? said Gov. Bevin. ?I have challenged Kentucky employers to think and act boldly, and Norton Healthcare has answered that challenge in an impressive way. This apprenticeship program is one of the first of its kind in the country and will be transformational for Norton?s workforce. I believe it will inspire other employers around Kentucky to explore ways that apprenticeships can take their business?and Kentucky?to the next level.?  With just over 70,000 active registered nurses currently in Kentucky, it is projected that an additional 4,500 nurses will be needed in the next 10 years to meet demand. The 125 new apprentices in this program will both provide Norton Healthcare with an effective workforce recruitment and training tool while also displaying the potential that this could bring to other healthcare providers across the county."
2015,Layla A. Jones Tribune,7/1/2017 10:52 AM,"Rebuild officials detailed a comprehensive list of initiatives put in place to ensure Rebuild work sites achieve the city's workforce diversity goals requiring that minority workforce hours account for 45 percent of all workforce hours, with 27 percent going to Black workers, during a Tribune editorial board meeting on Tuesday.

Officials released the memorandum of understanding between Mayor Jim Kenney's administration and the Building Trades, an agreement by the Trades to commit to the city's diversity goals.

""We think that this is a different effort this time because of this written commitment that the Trades are entering into committing them to a program,"" said Rebuild Executive Director Nicole Westerman.

A new arrangement with the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority allows the agency to hire individuals who are already skilled in a trade but not a member of any union for the purpose of working on Rebuild projects.

Upon being hired by the PRA, journeymen automatically earn a union card for their respective skilled trades.

The process was created specifically for Rebuild and is the first of its kind.

""There was a concern about whether this kind of workforce development program was appropriate for people who are older who already have skills in the trades but aren't actually in the union yet,"" Westerman explained Tuesday.

""And the thought was the PRA will be a place that hires those individuals [who] already have skills.""

According to the MOU, priority will be given to participants and graduates of such programs including the Construction Apprentice Preparatory Program and YouthBuild, craftspeople who have worked non-union trade jobs will also have employment opportunity.

PRA will handle Rebuild projects that cost less than $3 million according to the MOU. Generally, unions will work on projects that cost more than $3 million as part of a longstanding project labor agreement between the city and the Trades.

Each member of the Philadelphia Building and Construction Trades Council and the Carpenters Regional Council have signed on to the Rebuild MOU with the city.

It details a brand new initiative called PHL Pipeline, a program run collaboratively by the Kenney administration, Philadelphia Works and the Trades.

Council President Clarke distanced Council from the formation of the MOU but said, ""In large part, they adopted language that was in the legislation that [Council is] party to, that we passed ... which is a good thing.""

Unlike the PRA initiative, PHL Pipeline is designed for apprentice candidates who lack experience and expertise, Rebuild spokesman David Gould said.

Candidates can be referred by community-based organizations that are tapped into their neighborhoods and have access to potential apprentices including schools, faith-based organizations, veterans and re-entry initiatives.

PHL Pipeline will accept a cohort of 30 candidates will join on for the first year, and Rebuild representatives said they expect about 30 candidates each year over the duration of the seven year program, for a total of about 210 members.

Potential apprentices will undergo a two-and-a-half week boot camp before working for one year of paid employment on a Rebuild site.

""It's a program that we're really excited about because we think the biggest differentiator is from previous efforts is that the people who will be participating in this program will have paid, on the job experience,"" Westerman said.

""And so that's going to give them an income and it's going to give them an opportunity to understand what work in the trades is like, and get working experience and get a relationship going with one or more contractors.""

PennAssist, YouthBuild, CTE .... As MOU talks were being finalized between the administration and the Trades, Council legislated diversity into the Rebuild ordinance by requiring project users and contractors to employ participants and graduates of citywide pre-apprentice and job training programs.

Unions can choose graduates and participants from programs including the Diversity Apprenticeship Program, the School District's CTE program, YouthBuild and PennAssist, an initiative Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell works with closely.

""We specifically put it in for labor because we know that they've had a significant problem with finding the diversity they need on these worksites,"" Councilwoman Cindy Bass said in June after Council added the legislation.

""But certainly it should be applied equally to all contractors.""

The city's diversity goals are set based on data from the Office of Economic Opportunity 2016 disparity study.

Because the disparity study showed workers of color are often under-utilized, Westerman said unions will also be called upon to tap into their own paltry minority membership.

Westerman said to reach the goals, unions will be encouraged to get their members of color ""Off the bench.""

Before City Council passed Rebuild legislation with a 16-1 vote on Thursday, June 22, Councilmember concerns about achieving diversity were a prominent topic of months-long negotiations.

Council and community members expressed skepticism that there were not sufficient incentives or penalties for contractors who did not achieve the city's adopted diversity goals.

Councilman David Oh was the only councilmember who voted against the legislation, siting lack of enforcement.

Council's Rebuild legislation allows project users, the organizations overseeing Rebuild projects, to terminate a contract with any non-compliant contractor, Clarke said.

Councilwoman said there is not sufficient protocol to keep a project going in the event that a contractor fails diverse hiring requirements.

""One of the things that I spoke about a couple of times during the whole conversation is we need to give the project user the authority to fire [contractor] #1 if he's not doing his job and be able to go to #2 and #3,"" said.

If there's no operation dictating project users running Rebuild sites can jump to the second most qualified contractor if the first bidder is underperforming, said the project users may be afraid to ""Pull the trigger.""

With the MOU and legislation finalized, said the next opportunity to emphasize diversity compliance and enforcement is in drafting the contracts between project users and contractors.

""There's a commitment that as we develop the and certified project users that we're going to give them the authority to do what we haven't been able to do,"" the councilwoman said.

""How we write up those contracts is going to be hugely important."""
2019,James Redmond,7/10/2017  8:25 PM,"Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., on Monday introduced the Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology ? or CHANCE in Tech ? Act.  According to a news release from Gardner, the bipartisan legislation would provide industry intermediaries, such as state tech associations, the ability to receive federal grants to develop apprenticeships within the technology sector. It also would work to alleviate the skills gap that may slow the continued growth of the technology sector, the release stated.

In 2016 alone, the technology sector contributed more than $1 trillion to the U.S. economy, employed more than 7 million workers and added more than 100,000 new jobs, the release said. Nationally, however, during any given 90-day period, there can be more than 500,000 tech job openings, according to the release.  ""As the technology sector begins to play an even larger role in our economy, it's important our workforce has the necessary skills and training to perform these jobs,"" Gardner said in the release. ""The technology industry currently faces a workforce shortage and Congress must work together to address this problem. This bipartisan legislation ? will result in more Coloradans and Americans across the country receiving the proper training to enter the technology industry. The next 100 years will be defined by our ability to compete in the technology sector and the CHANCE in Tech Act will help the United States remain the global leader in technological developments."" "
2020,Charles Crumm,7/10/2017 11:09 AM,"Called the Michigan Career Pathways Alliance, its the latest initiative to match students to training for non-university occupations.

As many as 100,000 jobs are currently open because applicants dont have the skills to fill them.

The states official unemployment rate continues to fall.

In 33 of the states 83 counties, the unemployment rate is at or below 4 percent, the level that many economists consider to be full employment.

The low unemployment rates are particularly noticeable in southeast Michigan.

In May, the latest month that county-level rates were available, unemployment was 2.8 percent in Oakland and Washtenaw counties, and 3.6 percent in Macomb County.

John Paul Rea, executive director of the Macomb County Department of Planning and Economic Development, said positive employment trends can be attributed to diverse industry growth.

From production to service based operations, Macomb County is continually being viewed as a sound investment.

We are 15,666 jobs away from our all time high in Macomb County.

In all of Wayne County, which includes the city of Detroit, the unemployment rate was 4.8 percent.

The lowest in the state was 2.6 percent in Livingston County.

The highest was in Keweenaw County in the Upper Peninsula at 8.9 percent.

Seasonable job gains drove much of the lower unemployment rates.

Leisure and hospitality services added 23,000 jobs over the previous May, but those gains were partially offset by a 19,000 drop in jobs in public education at the end of the school year.

Compared to a year ago, construction jobs were up 12,000; professional and business services jumped by 12,000 jobs, and retail trade jobs are up by 10,000.

Apprenticeship programs at the college level also seek to address some of the shortages in some areas of the states economy.

Eighty percent of the jobs available today require more education and training than a high school diploma, but less than a four-year degree, according to OCC. The implication for the state of not filling skilled jobs is that companies could be discouraged from setting up shop in Michigan, possibly slowing down the states economy, according to Michigan Works!

Representatives at area industrial firms have fretted for years about the difficulty they have had filling skilled trades jobs.

Manufacturers have touted such jobs as provided solid careers with good wages without the need and expense of a 4-year college degree.

Hoping to find the workers they need, Paslin will host a job fair on July 11 from 1-7 p.m. at their headquarters located at 25303 Ryan Road in Warren.

Paslin has been a source of employment since 1937 and has a variety of openings for job seekers ranging from students right out of high school hired as apprentices, to experienced engineers and college graduates with electrical, mechanical or manufacturing engineering degrees with salaries ranging from $16 to $30 per hour.

Right now there is a shortage of qualified professionals in Michigan for construction jobs ranging from estimators to project managers, according to Baker College, which has several campus locations including Clinton Township.

Anca Sala, dean of engineering at Baker College, attributes this to a lack of awareness about career potential - an opinion based on two reports by the Associated General Contractors of America showing that nearly 80 percent of respondents to an AGC survey of Michigan contractors believe the difficulty in finding qualified construction professionals will continue or increase during 2017.

Another AGC report, based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, reports construction hiring is up nationally - with employment at its highest level in January since 2008.

These reports show that employment prospects are promising for graduates with Bachelors degrees in construction management, Sala said.

Baker College campus offers a bachelors in construction management taught by experienced industry professionals.

Construction management is a personally rewarding and highly paid career, Sala said.

These skilled professionals are the go-to men and women responsible for keeping construction projects on time and on or below budget.

Graduates are prepared to wear many hats in the construction industry involving construction project management, cost estimating, construction safety, project planning/scheduling and contract administration.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the annual median pay in 2015 for construction managers was $87,400 nationally and $88,980 in Michigan.

On the technical side are subjects as different as accounting, construction document analysis and advanced building technologies, Sala said.

Seasonally unadjusted unemployment rates in May rose moderately in 13 of the states 17 major labor market areas, according to the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget.

May jobless rates increased slightly in the majority of southern lower Michigan regions due to a large number of potential workers entering the labor market seeking summer and seasonal positions, said Jason Palmer, director of the Bureau of Labor Market Information & Strategic Initiatives.

Rates fell in northern lower Michigan as employers began hiring for tourism-related jobs.

Between April and May, jobless rate increases in the 13 areas were mostly minor and seasonal.

May rate advances ranged from 0.1 percent to 0.6 percent, with a median hike of 0.4 percent.

The largest rate gain of 0.6 percent point was posted in the Ann Arbor metropolitan statistical area, followed by a 0.5 percent increase in both the Muskegon and Kalamazoo-Portage areas.

Unemployment rates dropped in four areas in May, with the largest decrease of 1.2 percent, in the Northeast Lower Michigan region.

Other decreases were recorded in the Upper Peninsula, the Northwest Lower Michigan region, and the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn area.

In May, 10 of the states major areas along with the state registered unemployment rates below the U.S. non-seasonally adjusted rate of 4.1 percent."
2025,Staff Report,7/11/2017  2:00 PM,"Apprenticeship isn?t a new concept. It?s one of the oldest forms of training, with an inexperienced apprentice working alongside the seasoned professional to learn a trade. There?s a reason it?s been around for hundreds of years ? it works.  Most apprenticeships operate as the opposite of the traditional college-to-career track. Instead of going to college, graduating and finding a job, you begin with a job and receive a mixture of worksite and classroom training over an average of four years. For many apprenticeships, little or no job-related skills are needed at the beginning. It?s all learned on the job.

The concept is time-tested, but over the years many people have come to see apprenticeships through a very narrow window. It has long been the training method for skilled trades like carpenters, masons, machinists and other related occupations. While these are still pertinent, apprenticeships are relevant and effective in over a thousand occupations.  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, there are more than 530,000 apprentices in the U.S., and more than 662,000 new apprentices have been registered since 2014. Hawkeye Community College offers four levels of registered apprenticeships in electrical, HVAC, and plumbing . During the 2016-2017 fiscal year, 150 apprentices were employed at 50 companies across the Cedar Valley through Hawkeye?s apprenticeship programs."
2030,Tom Hopcroft,7/12/2017  2:00 PM,"Congressman Seth Moulton joined MassTLC member executives for a roundtable discussion on tech talent followed by the announcement of a bipartisan apprenticeship bill, the Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology (CHANCE in Tech) Act.  The roundtable was held in the Sixth Congressional District at MassTLC member company EBSCO Information Services, in Ipswich, MA, on July 10th. Joining Congressman Moulton and his staff were senior executives representing MassTLC and the following member companies ATN International, Cadence, Care.com, EBSCO Information Services, MITRE, Rocket Software, Vecna, and Verizon, plus invited guests from the Enterprise Center at Salem State, the North Shore Alliance for Economic Development, the North Shore Workforce Investment Board, and the Rocky Hill School. Attendees had a lively discussion around tech talent challenges and opportunities.

Attendees reflected the views of over 150 senior tech leaders surveyed for MassTLC?s forthcoming Tech Pulse survey that ?access to talent? was the number one reason for locating in Massachusetts but also the biggest challenge to growth. The tech sector and tech occupations contribute more than $80 billion to the Massachusetts economy and employ close to 400,000 workers, yet 23,000 tech jobs remain unfilled.  This tech talent crisis is not unique to Massachusetts. ?The U.S. is expected to have 1.8 million unfilled tech jobs by 2024,? said Elizabeth Hyman, CompTIA?s Executive Vice President of Public Policy in a statement. ?The deficit is not because of a lack of desire by American workers, but a dearth of workers with the necessary IT skills. If neglected, the IT skills gap will affect our country?s ability to protect national security interests and to compete economically on the global stage.? "
2032,Gerard Robinson,7/13/2017  8:00 AM,"My first introduction to Donald Trump occurred in 1987 when a college roommate showed me his copy of ""The Art of the Deal."" In the opening lines of chapter one, Trump stated, ""I don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need."" Most Americans will never have all the money they'll ever need, but Trump's recent executive order can potentially help them earn more than they have now.  The order, titled ""Expanding Apprenticeships in America,"" could help millions of working-age adults in need of newer skills; the ""idle army"" of jobless men Nicholas Eberstadt warns us about; prime work-age women (25-54 years old), who have a lower employment-to-population ratio than men; and younger people looking to fill current or newly created jobs after high school or college.

Trump's order has received a great deal of praise, and skepticism, in Washington and throughout the nation. The benefit to one population, though, has gone under the radar: The order would greatly expand opportunities for returned citizens.  It is heartening to see Trump focus on youth at risk of leaving high school without a diploma, or worse, falling into the school-to-prison pipeline at a young age. The same is true for adults incarcerated in state and federal prison, a population traditionally left out of modern-day public policy conversations, even though their success upon release from prison is essential to American communities, businesses and families."
2033,Staff,7/13/2017 11:08 AM,"""We want to push major manufacturing and the jobs that come with it back into the United States,"" said Scott Brown, Roper Corporation president.

""With this apprenticeship program, we are planning to advance the skill sets of our workforce."" Mr. Brown and Georgia Northwestern Technical College President Pete McDonald met to sign on the dotted line on a three-year Registered Apprenticeship project to train the next era of skilled workforce at the Northwest Georgia manufacturing giant.

Beginning in the 2017-18 academic year, GNTC will sponsor the new apprenticeship agreement with Walker County, Georgia's largest employer.

The pilot year of the apprenticeship project will begin with selected workers of Roper's 1,800-strong workforce heading to GNTC's Catoosa County Campus in Ringgold.

""We are going to be sending our workers to train in the college's Mechatronics program,"" said Scott Lee Reece, Roper Corporation Organizational Development leader.

GNTC's Whitfield Murray Campus currently takes part in two other registered apprenticeships with Mohawk Industries and The HON Company.

In those two cases it's the companies that are sponsoring the projects.

With ""Baby Boomers"" at Roper, as well as throughout the nation's workforce, planning to head off into retirement, companies now face a tough task.

They hope that either they will find the skilled workforce they need from within their communities or provide their current staff with the next generation training needed to fill the gaps.

""Our workforce is aging,"" added Alan Lyles, Roper Corporation Maintenance team leader for Assembly.

""There aren't enough workers available that have the skill sets we need now and in the near future. So, with the help of this apprenticeship program, we've decided to train some of our own."" With more than 1,800 in its workforce, the Roper Corporation is Walker County, Georgia's largest employer.

This major component of G.E.'s Appliance Division is also one of the largest employers across the Tennessee Valley.

The shortage companies of all sizes are facing is what the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics calls the Labor Skills Gap.

The bureau's most recent numbers show that job openings have increased nationwide.

At the same time, the number of new hires made by companies around the country has decreased.

The percentage of skilled labor available in the U.S. has steadily decreased every year since 2010.

That's where the Georgia Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship Program steps in.

""With the shortage of people having the right skill sets in some industries, this is a great way for a company to hire beginning workers and equip them with what they'll need to perform well,"" said Dr. Mindy McCannon, Georgia Northwestern Technical College vice president of Academic Affairs.

""They'll get the knowledge for their expertise from their coursework at the college. Then, they will get to apply what they've learned when they return to their company through the guidance of a journeyman. Apprenticeship is an idea that has been around for a long time. But now, it is getting renewed interest because of the skills gap we are facing.""

The Technical College System of Georgia, which GNTC is a unit of, is helping provide this occupation-related instruction to qualified candidates in Georgia's workforce.

""Georgia Northwestern has been a fantastic test pilot for the Registered Apprenticeship program,"" said Sarah Henderson, Regional Apprenticeship coordinator for Georgia WorkSmart.

The program can also help employers recruit and target employees eligible for the program.

Companies which take part can potentially have access to state and federal assistance towards the apprenticeship process for its workforce.

For the apprentice, it means a guaranteed raise in pay with each pre-determined benchmark they surpass during the Registered Apprentice process.

When an apprentice completes the Registered Apprenticeship program, they receive assistance with their career in the future, as well.

""When an apprentice completes a program, they will get a designation through the Georgia Department of Labor that says they are a registered apprentice,"" added Dr. McCannon.

""That recognition is looked highly upon across many industries. It shows that this person has acquired a certain level of knowledge and skill, as well as put those skill sets to work, successfully. A level that will assure employers that the apprentice has the right set of tools to perform well.""

The Georgia Department of Labor defines apprenticeship as a work-based training method that combines formal instruction with on-site, occupation-related training.

Apprentices typically work 30-40 hours per week and receive classroom training through part-time attendance at technical colleges, universities, or approved training providers.

Using the apprentice model can help businesses grow their own talent and build a motivated and qualified workforce.

Employers use apprentice programs to recruit and train new employees and to upskill their current workforce.

""We are going to do everything we can to help Roper succeed,"" said Pete McDonald, president of Georgia Northwestern Technical College."

Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream Co. will offer an apprenticeship in the trade of industrial maintenance mechanic, and the Tree Care Industry Association will offer an apprenticeship in the trade of arborist, marking the first time an arborist program has been approved in the state.

The department also approved Delaware-based Bauguess Electrical Services Inc. The employers are among more than 130 offering registered apprenticeship programs in Maryland.

The state has increased emphasis on such programs to help employers develop training and a pipeline of potential workers.

""By growing apprenticeship programs like these, we invest in Maryland businesses that need skilled employees, as well as Maryland workers looking for good-paying jobs,"" Gov. Larry Hogan said in the announcement Thursday.

Two employers, Brick House Brown Masonry Inc. and the Maritime Applied Physics Corp., which had previously been approved by the Maryland Apprenticeship and Training Council, were re-activated.

Bopat Electric Co. Inc., Dynamic Automotive and F.B. Harding Inc. were approved as eligible employers for a youth apprenticeship pilot currently underway in Frederick and Washington counties.

The program, a partnership between the state labor department, the Maryland State Department of Education, Frederick County Public Schools and Washington County Public Schools, offers jobs for high school juniors and seniors.

Yet despite the benefits, state lawmakers underutilize apprenticeship programs as a way to grow wages, according to a new report from the Budget & Tax Center, a project of the NC Justice Center.  Apprenticeship programs, which combine classroom learning with paid on-the-job training and guarantee job placement upon graduation, can lead to increased salary and set workers on a path to higher employment opportunities, the report said. The U.S. Department of Labor finds the average salary for a worker who completes an apprenticeship program is $50,000, and analysis shows individuals who participated in an apprenticeship program made $66,000 more during a nine-year study period than individuals who did not ($114,000 for participants, $48,000 for non-participants).

As of May 1, 2017, there were 5,256 apprentices enrolled in 308 active Registered Apprenticeship programs across the state. These programs are overseen by ApprenticeshipNC, a program within the NC Community College System that oversees the development the development and maintenance of apprenticeship programs throughout North Carolina. Individual employers can choose to host apprenticeship programs, and receive approval from the state to do so. Unfortunately North Carolina?s policymakers haven?t yet utilized the full potential of such apprenticeship programs, the report said.  ?Employers depend on ApprenticeshipNC on everything from developing programs that train workers to providing consultations on recruiting, screening, and testing of potential apprentices,? said Victoria Crouse, author of the report. ?A much needed investment in the work of ApprenticeshipNC can yield many more quality jobs across the state, as well as provide opportunities for mobility and prosperity for individuals, and their communities.?"
2049,N'dea Yancey-Bragg,7/17/2017 6:16 AM,"Although women make up roughly half the workforce, complete gender equity in the workplace is still a long way off.

If current trends persist, on average women won't receive equal pay until 2059, and that progress is even slower for women of color.

Even with the rise of sites like Glassdoor and Monster, many women are still left wondering exactly how prospective employers handle gender-specific issues in the workplace like family leave and pay equity.

To find out, female job seekers are turning to Fairygodboss, a job review site exclusively for women.

The site provides crowdsourced intel on how female-friendly company policy is at thousands of businesses.

The 2-year-old start-up just released their 2017 rankings of the best companies where women are happiest.

The rankings were based on the responses from almost 15,000 women about overall job satisfaction, gender equity and likelihood of recommending their company to another woman.

The data is pulled from the anonymous job reviews that Fairygodboss uses to create company profiles.

""One of the reasons we have this ranking is because our social mission is to improve the workplace environment for women,"" said Georgene Huang, CEO and co-founder of Fairygodboss.

""Our intent is for employers to learn from what companies at the top are doing right."" she continued.

Huang said she sees companies rise in the ranks when they make a concerted effort to promote more women into leadership and improve work-life balance.

At Boston Consulting Group, this year's winner, hiring and promoting more women has been a priority for more than a decade.

In just five years they were able to increase the number of women in their North American firms by 70% and raise women's retention rates to be equal or higher than men's.

Russell said the company also stepped up its recruiting of women and improved flexibility policies to make the company culture more inclusive.

Gender equity is an uphill battleWomen, particularly women of color, face a unique set of obstacles in almost every industry.

Men are 30% more likely to be promoted than women, which results in a disproportionate amount of male executives, according to a survey from Sheryl Sandberg's LeanIn.org and the McKinsey consulting group.

""When women say their company doesn't treat men and women equally, that's the No. 1 thing they point out,"" Huang said.

Through the Apprenticeship in Action initiative, the company was able to boost female promotion rates by 22% among senior managers.

Russell explained that while surrounding pieces like flex time and equal pay are important, improving the day to day experience is crucial to retaining women in leadership.

On Equal Pay Day this year, women still only made 82% of what men are paid.

For African-American and Hispanic women, that percentage drops to 68% and 62% respectively, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research.

Men tend to dominate higher paying jobs that require similar qualifications to lower paying, female dominated fields.

Huang said women bring up equal pay slightly less frequently than unequal promotion because the information is a lot less visible.

Women simply don't always know if they're being paid fairly.

Women also often bring up their employer's family leave policy in their job reviews.

""During my interviews I really wanted to ask about maternity policy and what the path for leadership was for women, but I felt like I couldn't for fear of looking less committed to my job,"" she said.

Improving parental leave and flex time policies is key to supporting women and men in the workplace, according to Russell.

Birth mothers at BCG can take up 16 weeks of family leave, and any employee can take two months of unpaid time off with full benefits.

Employees can use this ""Time for You"" for anything, whether it be extending family leave or learning how to horseback ride.

""I wanted to take a step back, so I took a leave to nanny my best friend's 3 month old in Juneau, Alaska,"" said Russell.

When she eventually did have children, Russell capitalized on BCG's flex time policy to help integrate her work and family life.

Russell worked at 80% capacity for about six months after her first daughter was born before coming back full time.

She recently returned to 80% capacity to spend more time with her two kids and her best friend's daughter, who is now 12, while they're on summer vacation.

Although big companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix have publicly improved their paid family leave policy, millions of Americans still aren't offered any time off after the birth or adoption of a child.

1 in 4 women go back to work just 10 days after childbirth according to a report from PL+US Paid Leave for the United States.

The Family Medical Leave Act gives women 12 weeks job-protected unpaid leave, but only 12% of U.S. non-government workers have access to paid family leave, according to the Department of Labor.

When it comes to family leave, women face consequences no matter what they do.

It seems like an apprenticeship is a perfect match for these two seekers.  If you haven?t gone through the work of building an apprenticeship program or partnership for your company, you might not know about four additional benefits that contractors stand to gain from hiring from an apprentice-trained pool. Recognizing these underlying perks can help you to craft an apprenticeship program today that will reap benefits tomorrow.

1. Apprentices Make for Loyal Team Members
2. Apprentices May Be More Productive
3. Apprenticeships Can Save You Money
4. Apprenticeships Can Boost Your Workplace Diversity

Apprenticeships are growing, thanks in part to action in recent years from the White House, but this growth remains fairly slow. It will take greater exposure to these programs to gain new applicants to apprenticeships. But construction companies should be heralding these programs as a way to not only boost their ranks with skilled labor, but to transform their company into a streamlined, efficient industry leader. "
2053,Valerie Bolden-Barrett,7/18/2017  3:00 PM,"Bloomberg reports that Johann Schneider-Ammann, Switzerland?s economy minister, plans to share his expertise on his nation's vocational training system with White House officials. The visit coincides with the Trump administration's goal to develop more apprenticeship programs.  In June, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to promote apprenticeships, which would pay on average $15 an hour. Former President Barack Obama first connected with Switzerland in 2015 to learn more about the country's success in administering vocational training programs.  Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta told Bloomberg that businesses struggle finding skilled workers and that apprenticeships could help close the skills gap.

After receiving a 'challenge' in March from Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, President Trump has actively promoted the development of ""5 million apprenticeships."" The Trump family visited a technical school in Wisconsin last month during a self-styled ""Apprenticeship Week"" to further showcase their commitment to such programs. Employment specialists say apprenticeships not only give unskilled workers on-the-job training, but they're also cost-effective, giving employers a good return on their investment.  The president's plan would redirect $100 million in federal job-training funds to the creation of new apprenticeships ? despite calling for funding cuts from similar aspects within the DOL to ease ""inefficiencies."" He also asked federal agencies to remove regulations that could stifle the programs, promoting the notion that employers could design their own apprenticeship programs."

2062,Christine L. Pratt,7/2/2017 4:54 AM,"Local apprenticeship program a model in Ohio By CHRISTINE L. PRATT Staff Writer Published: July 2, 2017 4:00 AM. WOOSTER - With a mission of most effectively using federal dollars and learning from the success of a local business, area business leaders and representatives from the Area 7 Workforce Development Board visited the LuK Academy and toured the Wooster facility.

Using OhioMeansJobs funding, apprenticeships basically offer an ""Earn-while-you-learn"" opportunity by combining on the job training with classroom instruction, according to Sundee Porter, Holmes County Job and Family Services employment services coordinator.

She was among those to visit LuK USA, a brand of the Schaeffler Group, hoping to bring federal funds into the area to duplicate the Wooster's business' program, with an aim of adding skills and increased wages to the Holmes County work force.

Apprenticeships offer an earn-while-you-learn opportunity by combining on-the-job training opportunity with classroom instruction, said Porter, noting the Ohio program requires a minimum requirement of 2,000 OJT hour and 144 classroom hours.

The training provider must be a university, career center or U.S. Department of Labor approved in-house training program.

State programs are facilitated through an articulation agreement, which sets for the curriculum and pay scales for each company and each position.

Once a candidate has completed all required hours on the job and in the classroom, the receive a certificate of apprenticeship which is considered a degree.

""The obvious bonus to the participant is that they have the opportunity to learn skills, both hands on and in the classroom that would otherwise have to be paid for but also they are able to earn while they learn,"" said Porter, adding, ""The not so obvious bonus is that this gives earnings guidelines and steps that an employee must take to gain their increases in earnings.""

This can be especially beneficial to companies contracted for prevailing wage jobs.

Absent an apprenticeship program, the employees in training, who require supervision, automatically get paid prevailing wage.

Where there is a formal apprenticeship program, they are considered to be in training, governed by the contract, and, because they are accompanied by a trainer, to not automatically receive the higher wage.

Locally, Porter said, ""I think what we're trying to do is grow apprenticeship awareness.""

""With one company already interested in piloting the program, she said,""It's an opportunity for an individual to come into employment and earn while they learn, with step pay increases.

To provide relief for participating companies and create interest in the program, funds are available to offset the costs of a program, said Erich Hetzel of the Ohio Apprenticeship Program.

The apprenticeship program at LuK was started in the 1980s and operates independently of the state program.

It's a program about which company leaders are very passionate.

""Our biggest successes are the employees who come through the program,"" said Carrie McKelvey, training and academy leader.

The program, she said, offers training in six program areas: machine repairer, industrial designer, tool and die maker, CNC planer, maintenance electrician and machine setup operator.

Adding dimension to the program, she said, the company is working with the Wayne County Schools Career Center to have a state-certified program and develop a pre-apprenticeship program, which allows students to complete the program earlier.

""To get top students, you need to start at the high school level,"" she said, noting she and other company representatives make frequent visits to area high schools, meeting with both students and parents, in an attempt to recruit into the program, into which they hire 35-40 individuals a year.

""Our goal is to have 108 at any time and graduate 21 a year,"" McKelvey said, adding, ""If you want your program to succeed, you have to invest time in making yourself known to candidates and schools.""

Internally, they measure and maintain success through a series of monthly reports and quarterly evaluations, working with students to help them get back on track if they fall behind.

They strive to make their apprentices the cream of the crop.

""At the end, we want the managers of all the departments fighting over the graduating apprentices,"" said David Brucato, director of operations, noting the company has 171 documented graduates of the program since its inception.

Graduates, he said, have grown to be successful in the company, as evidenced by the fact many company leaders are graduates of the program, which is the largest manufacturing apprenticeship program in Ohio.

""I appreciated the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at the Schaeffler training academy. It is an impressive facility. The company has been very forward-thinking in their efforts to develop talent internally, and their strategy appears to be paying dividends,"" Leininger said, adding, ""I expect that, in the years to come, we will see other local companies taking a similar approach to work force development.""

2065,Staff,7/20/2017 12:34 AM,"Promising that apprenticeships are going to be a ""Major factor in our country,"" President Trump is leading the charge to reform the failed federally funded job-training and workforce development programs.

The recently passed H.R. 2353 reduces the role of the federal government in workforce programs.

Education and the Workforce Committee ChairmanVirginia Foxx, in her FoxNews commentary, wrote that educational institutions, private companies, and community leaders must work together to create apprenticeship programs without the federal government dictating implementation.

Despite this House effort to return workforce development to local control, lawmakers are plowing ahead with new legislation for more government control.

H.R. 2933 promotes the expansion of registered apprenticeships for integration with postsecondary education and the government as a collaborator - and more federal strings and inefficiency.

Companion bills H.R. 3174 and S.1518 empower the Labor Department to set up contracts with industry leaders to promote apprenticeships in the technology sector.

Does Big Tech really need the federal government to develop an apprenticeship program?

Apprenticeships involve a team effort of employer and education provider for hands-on training of prospective workers.

Although the majority of Americans don't get jobs through apprenticeships, the U.S. Department of Labor reports that nine in 10 of those who serve as apprentices get jobs following their training with average beginning salaries of $60,000 a year.

There are six million job openings in the United States, the highest number since 1980, with the number increasing to 11 million by 2022.

Millions of American workers do not have the necessary skills to fill these American jobs.

According to a 2014 Georgetown University study, by 2020 some form of education or training beyond high school will be required for 65 percent of all jobs and it will not necessarily be a college degree.

For this reason, apprenticeship programs are highly popular among policymakers at the moment.

The downside to the government workforce program is that high school students are being trained for specific jobs with skill certificates rather than educating them broadly.

The purpose of American public education is no longer academic learning but rather workforce training as the U.S. moves toward a centrally planned economy.

Under the School-to-Work Act passed in the 1990s, decision-making about careers is being forced on children as early as kindergarten.

By the end of the 8th grade, students must select career options from a cluster of 16 sectors of the economy carved out by the federal government.

Encouraged to focus on careers that are currently in high demand, by the end of the 10th grade students must make a final decision about their careers.

What if a 23-year-old decides the career choice made in his teens is now the wrong choice for his adult life? Since he has no government-issued skill certificate in the new career choice, is this young adult just out of luck? What if this 23-year-old lacks the basic academic skills in reading, math, and English because the emphasis on workforce training crowded out strong foundational academics?

This concern is supported in the new international study by Stanford's Hanushek et al about the impact of a general education vs. a vocational education on long term labor market outcomes.

The study concludes that even though students benefit from Career and Technology Education early in their careers, technological changes can make them less adaptable to employment changes later in life.

Vocational degrees can become obsolescent as industries weaken, jobs are replaced, and and job skills become outdated.

The study notes that lifetime earnings in countries with slower growing economies are favored by a vocational education while more rapidly growing national economies favor a general high school curriculum or college for career-long benefits.

In a nutshell, an apprenticeship can be an excellent way for a young person to land a job short term, but a broader education can be critical for a lifetime of successful work.

If federal control over workforce decisions increases, it is inevitable that students will lose another right - a personal choice in their career decisions.

The danger is that it can lead to the German-style government tracking of students for specific jobs to satisfy State determined workforce needs with workers unable to make changes.

Since D.C. politicians are now quietly advancing a national student database to track students for workforce needs, this is not such a far-fetched idea."

2077,Katherine S. Newman & Hella Winston,7/24/2017  10:57 AM,"Very few policy ideas excite both parties in this period of political polarization. Apprenticeship and the renaissance of technical education is, however, one of them. The Obama administration invested millions to launch a federal apprenticeship office, while President Trump has made it one of his signature ideas as he tries to address the re-industrialization of economically depressed regions of the country.  Twin goals are at play on the right and the left: the revival of manufacturing industries, which are desperate for skilled labor, and the need to develop pathways to good jobs?especially for non-university-bound youth?that technical high schools, community colleges, and training programs have been trying to forge. Virtually everyone in the policy world accepts that we must do more to move the American labor force toward the kind of high-skilled foundation that is common in Germany and Austria.

Despite this consensus, the U.S. is very far behind in expanding apprenticeship and the technical education that underpins it. We currently have 506,000 federally registered apprentices and have allocated $2.7 billion dollars to support them. In Germany, with an economy one quarter the size of the U.S., there are 1.4 million apprentices and the annual expenditure for them is $9 billion. The skill of the German labor force is unparalleled in the world and has helped that country become a dominant force in international trade. Its investment has paid off handsomely."

""Apprenticeships are a cornerstone of President Trump's plan to close the skills gap and ensure the American workforce is prepared to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow,"" Acosta said July 24.

""The Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion's recommendations will serve as vital guidance for the U.S. Department of Labor as we work with industry groups, companies, unions, non-profits, and educational institutions to expand apprenticeship programs across the U.S."".

Some other news on the apprenticeship front: Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation has approved three new eligible employers for the Apprenticeship Maryland youth apprenticeship pilot, announcing that Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream Company and the Tree Care Industry Association joined the ranks of the more than 130 active Registered Apprenticeship programs currently offered in the state.

Nestle will offer an apprenticeship in the trade of industrial maintenance mechanic and the Tree Care Industry Association will offer an arborist apprenticeship - a first for the state.

Delaware-based Bauguess Electrical Services, Inc. was also approved by the state.

The DOL task force, which Acosta will chair, has been asked to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeship programs are currently insufficient.

The task force's final report to Trump will include recommendations on federal initiatives to promote apprenticeships, administrative and legislative reforms that would assist apprenticeship programs, the most effective strategies for creating industry-recognized apprenticeships, and the most effective strategies for amplifying and encouraging private-sector initiatives to promote apprenticeships.

Applications must be postmarked by Aug. 8 or, if submitted electronically or by hand delivery, received by that date.

Applications must be accompanied by a copy of the nominee's resume; a cover letter about the individual, including a description of relevant experience and subject-matter expertise of that person concerning the development of a skilled workforce through quality apprenticeship programs; and contact information for the nominee."
2092,Katie Arcieri,7/27/2017  3:29 PM,"The new Apprenticeship Randolph program is gaining momentum in its inaugural year, with more.  A four-year youth apprenticeship program that began this year in Randolph County is gaining momentum, with dozens of local students applying to work at companies offering paid positions in their plants.

The Apprenticeship Randolph program recently garnered 44 applicants from local students, 22 of whom met requirements that include maintaining a minimum 2.5 grade point average and good attendance records, said Nancy Cross, Randolph County Schools' director of career and technical education and innovative school design.  She said the majority of the eligible high school students accepted ""Pre-apprenticeships,"" a six-week program designed to match up candidates for paid positions at companies including Asheboro-based Pemmco and Mohawk Industries."
2093,Jeffrey Anderson,7/27/2017  5:00 AM,"With the building boom unabated, one issue D.C. voters can expect to hear a lot about come election year is jobs. Every public land sale, commercial project, mixed-use development, or residential complex comes with mayoral promises of opportunities for a growing labor force.  But the D.C. Apprenticeship Council?s recent certification of an out-of-state contractor and accusations of wage fraud have prompted an investigation by Attorney General Karl Racine and claims by unions and labor advocates that a bad actor is going unchecked. At-large D.C. Councilmember Elissa Silverman worries that the District isn?t enforcing its own labor laws.  ?We don?t want to be approving apprenticeships for companies that don?t follow the law, don?t pay employees a fair wage, and engage in bad labor practices,? she says. ?We don?t want to rely on bad actors to train employees.? 

The apprenticeship council is an 11-member body within the Department of Employment Services that is supposed to ensure compliance with local and federal labor laws and standards. In order to bid on major projects, contractors must have a certain number of licensed skilled workers and apprentices on the job. Certification as an apprenticeship sponsor helps contractors compete for those projects.  Certifying companies that fail to meet wage and overtime standards, labor sources say, is a disincentive for those companies to properly classify and train electricians, plumbers, and drywall and HVAC installers. Profit margins become irresistible to unscrupulous contractors at the expense of workers who are underpaid and struggling to advance in their trades. "
2097,Kathy Gurchiek Jul 28,7/28/2017 1:07 AM,"Which internship programs are better-those registered with the federal government or a state or ones that are industry- or employer-led? Members of the U.S. House of Representatives are comparing the value of these apprenticeship programs and considering whether changes would improve workforce development.

Under the federal Registered Apprenticeship system, programs are registered with the Department of Labor or with a state office of apprenticeship that meets certain standards.

The federal government has certified apprenticeship programs for more than 75 years, according to the DOL. There are more than 533,000 apprenticeships available for more than 1,000 occupations throughout the U.S. Industry- or employer-led programs may be competency-based but aren't registered with the DOL. At a hearing Wednesday before the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, Stacey J. Hughes, HR unit manager at Logan Aluminum in Russellville, Ky., extolled the virtues of industry/employer-led apprenticeship programs.

She serves as the state chairman for the Kentucky Federation of Advanced Manufacturing Education.

KY FAME is made up of regional manufacturers working with educational institutions to create a pipeline of highly skilled workers in manufacturing.

Hughes, a Society for Human Resource Management member, was one of four people appearing before the subcommittee.

Another witness, Rob Hogan, is vice president of manufacturing and material distribution at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia-a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries-and an alumnus of The Apprentice School in Newport News.

Its 19 shipbuilding apprenticeships and eight advanced apprenticeships are registered through the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry, he told committee members.

The school partners with state and local officials and educational institutions and is involved with workforce investment boards.

Although Hogan said he didn't think the DOL program was ""Burdensome or complicated,"" Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-N.Y., noted that the committee sees room for improvement in the nation's registered apprenticeship system.

""[We are] looking for a better way to build on the successful efforts businesses have found to grow their own apprenticeship programs outside of the registered apprenticeship [system]"" Guthrie said.

The DOL has 26 requirements for designing registered programs, he noted, which some people consider too unwieldy to respond to rapidly changing workforce skills needs.

He pointed out that less than half of earn-and-learn programs choose to register their programs with the DOL. ""In 2016, only 206,000 people became apprentices through the registered apprenticeship program,"" Guthrie said.

Hughes asked the subcommittee to introduce legislation to promote programs such as KY FAME. In that program employers work with community colleges to create career pathways in manufacturing.

Students work 24 hours a week for a local employer, which pays them, and attend community college for two eight-hour days a week.

Within five semesters, they earn a two-year associate's degree-and certification as an advanced manufacturing technician-and gain two years of work experience.

The sponsoring employer pays the student's school expenses.

In June, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training.

The order included a directive that ""Federally funded education and workforce development programs that do not work must be improved or eliminated so that taxpayer dollars can be channeled to more effective uses.""

Michael Bennett, vice president of Cianbro Companies-a 100 percent employee-owned company in Pittsfield, Maine, that provides construction and construction services-spoke on behalf of the Associated Builders and Contractors.

He said both the federal apprenticeship system and industry/employer-led apprenticeships have value.

ABC provides apprenticeship programs that are registered with the DOL as well as nonregistered, industry-recognized programs.

His company uses DOL-registered apprenticeship programs, he said, but ""We feel there are some impediments to using the system, and we see room for improvement.""

He pointed to an oil refinery that his company recently upgraded-the largest upgrade of its kind in decades in the U.S., he said-that required 250 pipe welders.

Under the registered apprenticeship system, that would require 144 hours of classroom time and a minimum of 2,000 work hours, Bennett said.

His company developed the welders it needed within one week through its own program.

""The construction industry has not been built on registered apprenticeships alone. Many organizations are providing workforce development opportunities for their teams that are outside that registered apprenticeship model,"" Bennett stated.

""It's not that the is broken but there is more than one way to develop skilled professionals in this country,"" he told committee members.

Referring to the executive order directive to improve-or eliminate-federally funded education and workforce development programs that don't work, Bennett said it is ""Very premature to exclude anything right now."" He urged committee members to ""Look at what is working and [see] how we can enhance those models.""

The committee will continue to explore innovative earn-and-learn opportunities as the private sector seeks solutions to the skills gap.

2100,C.j. Prince,7/28/2017 2:28 PM,"Patrick J. Dempsey, president and CEO of Barnes Group, a global industrial and aerospace manufacturer and service company, knows the value of apprenticeships because he began his career with one.

At age 16, he became an apprentice at a shipbuilding company in Ireland, learning welding techniques, among other skills.

Although he did go back to school for both his BA and his MBA, it was the apprenticeship that set him on course for his future success.

""I believe apprenticeships instill those values from the very beginning of a person's career, giving them a solid foundation upon which to build and enabling them to go on to do great things, both in the workplace and in society as a whole.""

When Dempsey took over Barnes Group, he ramped up the company's apprenticeship program, which currently has 124 apprentices in place.

Barnes Group is in the minority of American companies offering such apprenticeships.

Unlike European countries, such as Germany and Switzerland, that have made apprenticeships a preferred career path, the U.S. has maintained a focus on the four-year college degree.

""Our educational system pushed everybody to go to college and forgot about the technical trade,"" says Linda Wood, trainings program coordinator for Oberg Industries, a diversified manufacturer with more than 750 employees worldwide.

Wood, who once taught in the public school system, says the overemphasis on college diplomas is misguided.

""We've created this conundrum here in the U.S. where we're grading schools based on how many kids go to college and anyone outside of college is left holding the bag,"" she says.

As a result, the U.S. has been at a disadvantage in the war for talent, particularly as it relates to manufacturing.

""We are coming up on a large deficit of people due to a perceived lack of attractiveness of manufacturing and people having the necessary STEM skills required for them to be successful,"" says Dempsey.

Over the next decade, 3.4 million manufacturing jobs will become available as baby boomers retire and the economy expands, but 2 million of them will go unfilled due to the widening skills gap, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute.

This projection comes despite the fact that 80% of manufacturers say they are willing to pay above-market rates in areas where talent is hardest to find.

Apprenticeships provide a solution for companies willing to invest up front.

They offer participants a debt-free ""Earn-while-you-learn"" alternative to the traditional college route, as they typically begin receiving a salary from the moment they're accepted and, at the same time, earn credits toward an associate's degree at a local community college.

""Our apprentices pay absolutely nothing for the 26 college credits we provide to each of them,"" says Wood.

""By the time they're 21, they are making a good wage and can afford a home. We have many people with four-year college educations applying to come into our apprentice program because, quite frankly, they can't find a job.""

A HEALTHY ROITo be sure, there are significant upfront costs, including tuition, educational materials and labs, apprentice compensation and benefits, recruiting and marketing, and overhead. Apprentices are typically paired with mentors who oversee their progress, an additional time-suck.

The return is big, says Dr. James Weinstein, CEO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System, which launched an apprentice program in 2014 to train medical assistants for its new primary care clinic in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

""It's a rural community and we didn't have the workforce we needed there, so we needed a way to attract new talent, younger folks.""

In the first go-round, more than 2,500 people showed up to apply for 250 apprentice spots.

The program cost of approximately $59,700 per medical assistant apprentice was offset by a $48,000 per-apprentice reduction in overtime costs and $7,000 per apprentice in increased revenue from medical appointment bookings, according to an independent study done by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Case Western University.

""Whatever it's costing us to train these people, we're reducing overtime expenses, physician turnover and staff burnout; and we're increasing our appointments book and improving preventive care completions with over 40% internal rate of return on our investment, which is amazing,"" says Weinstein.

Weinstein doesn't share the fear that some CEOs have about investing big bucks to train apprentices only to have them poached by a competitor.

""That's always a possibility,"" he says, noting that so far, the program has a 90% retention rate.

""But when you invest in people, when you train people and when you invest in their future, you get loyalty and you create a culture of caring.""

""I see why it would be a concern, but at the end of the day, people want to work for Dow because they see a safe, secure, profitable company,"" says Carie LaFond, public affairs leader for Dow's HR communications.

In 2015, after a brief pilot period, Dow initiated an apprenticeship program in the U.S. in an effort to address the shortage of qualified talent.

""We also have an aging workforce here at Dow, so for us, the apprenticeship program is not only filling that immediate gap, but it's letting us use the knowledge we have in our current workforce and share that knowledge with the new resources we're bringing in,"" explains LaFond.

Dow currently has more than 100 apprentices across Michigan, California, Texas and Louisiana, with a 95% retention rate, and has plans to expand.

LaFond acknowledges that apprenticeships can be a harder sell to parents who may have had their hearts set on a college education for their kids.

She is quick to add that the apprenticeship program is a debt-free path to an associate's degree.

""And then you're going to have an opportunity to work for a company where one of the benefits is tuition assistance"" for those who want to go on to earn a bachelor's.

A MODEL FOR ALL INDUSTRIESToday, more than three-quarters of apprenticeships in the U.S. are in manufacturing, but the model is rapidly expanding across industries, with programs springing up in healthcare, IT, advanced manufacturing, transportation and logistics and energy.

""Apprenticeship is really just a model for training that can apply to almost any industry or occupation,"" says Sarah Steinberg, vice president of global philanthropy for JPMorgan Chase.

In 2015, Houston Community College received a $4.2 million grant to develop apprenticeship programs with a host of companies, including JPMorgan.

The bank will ultimately hire 43 apprentices from HCC; they will undergo a year-long information technology apprenticeship and then be transitioned into full-time roles with the company.

""It's also a good way of recruiting a more diverse population. If you're just going to hire people out of the top bachelor's degree programs, there are a lot of reasons why that doesn't end up being the most diverse group.""

2104,Brendan Pringle,7/3/2017  11:00 AM,"As the Trump administration works to expand apprenticeship programs and match young workers with well-paying opportunities, the State of California is naturally going the opposite direction. Snubbing apprenticeships and trade schools, California legislators are instead working to incentivize their increasingly expensive university system.  Under California?s new budget deal, students who meet the baseline requirements for the California State University (CSU) system will get accepted to at least one CSU school. Currently, the University of California (UC) system already promises admission to students who rank in the top 9 percent of graduates in the state.

This move does nothing to help fill the massive skills gap driving the national unemployment rate. As Labor Secretary Alex Acosta noted, ?This skills gap is a particular challenge in some of the fastest growing sectors of the economy: financial services, healthcare and information technology.? He also pointed out that there are 360,000 vacancies in manufacturing and 200,000 available construction jobs ? jobs that, for the most part, do not require a four-year degree.  Apprenticeships also mean virtually zero debt for those participating in them. As Secretary Acosta succinctly put it, ?Apprentices earn while they learn.? Meanwhile, California?s college graduates are saddled with an average debt of more than $22,000, and face limited job opportunities compared to pre-Recession levels. The unemployment rate for college graduates is around 5.6 percent, and the underemployment rate has grown to 11.9 percent."
2108,Joel Mendelson,7/31/2017  10:00 AM,"In early June, President Trump strolled up to a podium and announced his intention to expand the Labor Department?s apprenticeship program. Trump pontificated about the important role apprenticeships play in matching working people with job training opportunities. Giving credit where credit is due, Trump was right. However, Trump?s words do not match what?s included in his proposal. Apprenticeships require an appropriate level of government funding and oversight to ensure corporations put the interests of apprentices ahead of their profits. Apprenticeships, if operated well, have immense value for working people in a range of industries, including construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. Programs run jointly by unions of working people and employers allow people to earn quality wages, benefits, and a hands-on, debt-free education.

And yet Trump?s proposal fails greatly on those counts. Trump?s apprenticeship program could lead to increased exploitation of apprentices, halt progress for women and people of color to move into good careers in construction and other sectors where they are underrepresented, and harm the futures of working people setting their sights on a sustainable career path.  One key reason the president?s words ring hollow is that his proposed budget takes a machete to the Labor Department?s job training and apprenticeship programs. Trump proposed . Elected officials of but the president believes he can fund 5 million apprenticeships. Simple math suggests those numbers do not add up."
2109,Community Contributor Isaac Sancken,7/31/2017 1:52 PM,"Congressman Dan Lipinski has introduced the Veterans Apprenticeship and Certification Act to help veterans find the right career after military service and help employers find these qualified, dedicated, and hard-working Americans.

Currently, veterans are not allowed to use their Post-9/11 GI benefits for the tuition and fees associated with participating in an apprenticeship.

Lipinski's bill would allow them to use their benefits for an apprenticeship program, which would greatly expand their ability to find the right career path once they leave military service.

It would also provide them with opportunities to create professional connections and develop other professional skills.

""As a veteran transitions and separates from military service, an apprenticeship can help them bridge the gap between service in the Armed Forces and civilian employment,"" said Rep. Lipinski.

""Apprenticeships offer veterans the opportunity to receive on-the-job training under the direct supervision of a professional accompanied by classroom instruction. They also provide veterans the opportunity to demonstrate and transfer the skills they acquired during military service to a civilian career.""

According to the Department of Labor, there are over 350,000 job openings in manufacturing.

Lipinski's legislation would also direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to work with private industry to develop a pilot program for a National Institute for Metalworking Skills certification in computer numerically controlled machining.

A CNC certification is critical for anyone pursuing a career in metalworking and modern manufacturing.

In May of this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 4.6 percent of post-9/11 veterans were unemployed compared to 4 percent of nonveterans.

""As the number of apprenticeship programs increase and apprenticeships expand into new industries, our veterans should be put in a position to capitalize on that industry demand,"" stated Lipinski.

""We owe veterans so much that we can never repay, but with this bill we can help provide them with some assistance to get a good job and start a promising career after serving our nation in the Armed Forces."""
2110,Cmaadmin,7/31/2017 2:12 AM,"While working a $15-an-hour job as security guard at a Caterpillar plant in Joliet, Ill., Ed Richardson knew he had to get more education and training to have a real shot at a career.

Richardson, 25 - who had already dropped out of a junior college in Texas - wanted to get back into school.

""I needed to look for a new opportunity, and without college or any formal training, it's tough to find opportunities,"" Richardson said.

So Richardson set up a job search on indeed.com.

He used keywords such as ""Trainee"" and ""Apprenticeship"" - the latter term being an idea he got from other Caterpillar employees who told him that apprenticeships were how they had gotten into the company.

It was that keyword - apprenticeship - that caused Richardson's job search results to come back one morning with an enticing ad. The ad was for an apprenticeship at the Chicago offices of Aon, a global insurance company.

The deal got sweeter - Aon would pay the apprentice's college tuition.

""The job description made it a no-brainer,"" Richardson said.

After going through a series of phone, video and in-person interviews with Aon managers, Richardson is now about six months into his apprenticeship as a claims analyst with Aon Benfield, a reinsurance intermediary.

Aon apprentices take courses toward an associate's degree in business management, with concentrations in either HR, insurance or IT to correlate with their roles at Aon.

""You get your schooling paid for and then - with your 40-hour weeks [including] school time - you're compensated for school as well,"" Richardson said.

Apprentices are guaranteed full-time positions at the end of their apprenticeships, a public relations specialist for the company said, although it remains to be seen whether and how those offers will work out.

As Richardson seeks to use his apprenticeship to catapult himself toward a career in the insurance industry, both President Donald J. Trump and Congress are looking to expand apprenticeship opportunities for the nation as a whole.

They say apprenticeships represent an effective workforce development strategy that gives students a way to make money and affordably educate themselves for bigger and better things.

""Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees,"" President Trump said in June as he signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships.

Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta put out a call for nominations for individuals to serve on President Trump's new Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion.

The task force is considered a ""Key step"" in implementing President Trump's executive order to expand apprenticeships.

There are currently 206,000 Registered Apprenticeships with the U.S. Department of Labor.

President Trump has indicated he wants to expand the number of apprenticeships to five million - although not necessarily through the U.S. Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship program.

His executive order calls for third parties to promote development of industry-recognized apprenticeship programs.

The order also calls for federal support for community colleges and other two-and four-year institutions of higher education to incorporate apprenticeship programs into their courses of study.

U.S. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi highlighted the Aon apprenticeship program specifically, noting that Aon apprentices get paid ""Competitive salaries"" and are offered full employee benefits.

Aon apprentices are currently paid $38,000, which includes salary, benefits and a year's tuition at Harold Washington College.

Much of the subcommittee's hearing focused on merits of the Registered Apprenticeship program versus third party industry-recognized apprenticeships being touted by the Trump administration.

The Aon apprenticeship is a Registered Apprenticeship, according to a company spokesperson.

Lawmakers sought to make a meaningful distinction between Registered Apprenticeship and industry-recognized certifications.

Republican lawmakers spoke more in favor of non-registered third party apprenticeships as being more nimble and the Registered Apprenticeships as being too encumbered with bureaucracy.

Krishnamoorthi said part of the argument in favor of Registered Apprenticeships is that they ""Ensure a certain level of quality across the board, and so we can ensure that our children and students and others who are perhaps in career transition and engaged in apprenticeships are engaged in something that can transfer around the country, because everyone can trust in it.""

Michael Bennett, vice president of Cianbro Companies, a Maine-based construction company, and chair of the National Associated Builders and Contractors' workforce development committee, testified that there is value in both Registered Apprenticeships as well as industry-recognized certification.

While Registered Apprenticeships are structured to have classroom time and on-the-job learning, the non-registered programs can be ""As strict, if not more strict than an apprenticeship model,"" Bennett testified.

Richardson said one of the most beneficial aspects of the apprenticeship is that he gets to apply what he learns ""As opposed to being in college and waiting for four years to see if you can remember everything you learned or not.""

""You go to class one day, go back to work the next day and try something new and get instant feedback, not wait four years and seventy-thousand dollars to get feedback on whether you're doing something correctly,"" Richardson said.

""You can go over to the school and actually work on things like crafting e-mails, working on a marketing project, and you can come over here and deal with real experts and get key insights,"" Richardson said.

Bridget Gainer, vice president for global public affairs at Aon, said the apprenticeship was born out of the recognition that the company could fill positions that the company had historically filled with holders of bachelor's degrees with lesser-skilled individuals and get better results in terms of retention and diversity.

""If you're only hiring from places that don't have diversity in college, you're going to get less diversity at your entry level ranks,"" Gainer said, noting that the city's two-year colleges were more diverse than the four-year colleges from which Aon historically hired its entry-level candidates.

Company executives also realized they were overlooking talent at Harold Washington College, a city college just two blocks away.

The college is 42 percent Hispanic and 30 percent African American, figures that are roughly twice the rate those groups are represented in four-year colleges.

Gainer said Aon didn't want to recruit from Harold Washington as a ""Social program,"" but rather in a way that was integrated into the company's overall training and recruitment and that was ""Good for the business.""

The company drew upon its experience with apprenticeships in Germany and the United Kingdom - where apprentices have higher retention and engagement rates - to make the case that apprentices could cut down on attrition at its Chicago office and thus save the company money that it would have otherwise had to spend on training.

""If Aon can do it and the red carpet is rolled out for us, I know other companies are capable of doing it also,"" Richardson said."
2113,Staff Report,7/4/2017  4:00 AM,"A new program will create more insurance jobs in Connecticut.

2122,Marlene Y. Satter,7/7/2017  12:00 PM,"Apprenticeship programs are growing as states realize that they?re facing ?a wave of retirements??but the new programs could help older workers retrain so they can keep working longer.  Alternatively, those programs could also ensure that there?s a ready crop of younger workers to choose from and lessen the possibility that an older worker can stay on the job past retirement.  A PBS Newshour report says that as the federal government is encouraging apprenticeships, to the extent of providing funding for grants and tax credits to encourage private sector companies to offer them, some state agencies are taking heed and setting up their own programs, with paid training.

Older workers who see the handwriting on the wall in their current jobs or industries might want to investigate potential apprenticeship programs in various fields, particularly if they envision themselves working for years yet rather than leaving the job at retirement age.  But, conversely, those already on the job might find themselves watching their successors come up through the ranks as state agencies try to stay a step ahead of mass departures due to age."

The WannaCry ransomware attack crippled healthcare institutions across Great Britain and affected hospitals in the U.S. The Petya attack shut down critical infrastructure in Ukraine; left global shipping giant Maersk reeling; halted operations at a Cadbury chocolate plant in Australia; and struck the property arm of French bank BNP Paribas.

Cyber attacks will continue to become more complex, frequent and destructive.

CompTIA research shows that up to 32 percent of companies say that they need to significantly improve their cybersecurity expertise, while only 21 percent of businesses feel that their cybersecurity protections are completely satisfactory.

In a recent study focusing on the IT skills gap, companies say they've come up short in data security, traditional security safeguards such as firewalls and antivirus software, and cloud security skills.

According to Cyberseek, employer demand for cyber talent exceeds supply in many parts of the country.

Beyond dedicated security roles, employers are struggling to fill an estimated 200,000 other IT positions with a cybersecurity component.

By 2022, it is expected that there will be a global shortage of 1.8 million cybersecurity workers.

The good news is that the cyber workforce shortage can be fixed rather quickly.

Here are four common sense actions that can help reverse the tide.

The Championing Apprenticeships for New Careers and Employees in Technology Act, introduced into the U.S. House this month, addresses the IT talent gap facing employers across all 50 states.

The Secretary of Labor will award contracts that support apprenticeship programs that facilitate a meaningful public-private partnership, ensure that quality candidates are recruited, and provide compressed and targeted training to meet specific employer needs.

Jointly funded by the National Security Agency and the National Science Foundation, the program provides summer cybersecurity camp experiences for middle school and high school students, and helps teachers learn how to teach cybersecurity.

Government support for training the next generation of cyber workers is vital.

Legislation introduced this year to expand the DoD Cyber Scholarship Program Act and Cyber Scholarships Opportunity Act deserve support.

These programs aid with costs for tuition and training in return for commitments to government service.

Easy ways for workers to identify the training they need.

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a cybersecurity education, training and workforce partnership between the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector that merits ongoing funding.

The NICE Workforce Framework provides an easy way to classify cyber workers by describing cyber work roles across work categories.

Our cybersecurity focus should not be one of doom and gloom, woe is us.

Quite the contrary, we need to look at cybersecurity as an opportunity.

If we do this right, cybersecurity provides a tremendous job pipeline for workers of varying education levels and in disparate locales.

A smart cyber infrastructure and workforce will enable the free flow of commerce and trusted relationships with business partners and customers, leading to the realization of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and autonomous cars.

The time for investment is now and it starts with ensuring our workforce is vibrant and skilled enough to meet this critical national challenge."

Today continued the Wolf Administration's 'Jobs that Pay' tour at Penn United Technologies L.I.G.H.T. Center's apprenticeship training facilities in Butler County.

Initiatives that invest in 21st century manufacturing, workforce development, and training programs.

""Apprenticeship programs provide job seekers with valuable training and hands-on experience and create a pool of highly-skilled, qualified talent for employers,"" said Deputy Secretary Cipriani.

""This program at Penn United Technologies is an excellent example of how apprenticeships benefit the local economy and create family-sustaining jobs.""

Penn United Technologies, Inc. is a high precision manufacturing solutions provider with nine different apprenticeship programs registered with the ATO. The training programs range in length from one to five years and include precision machinist, plating technician, machine operator, and toolmaker.

The company's L.I.G.H.T. Center is used to train apprentices, conduct customer and community trainings, and for pre-apprenticeship training programs.

""Penn United Technologies is dedicated to providing world-class manufacturing training for our employees, training approximately 400 apprentices since the program's inception in 1973,"" said the company's training coordinator Scott Covert.

""The apprenticeship program is an appealing recruiting and retention tool, setting the apprentices on a pay and skill track based on their ability, while also providing them with valuable certifications from the state.""

Since the Wolf Administration established the ATO last year, the office, which is responsible for providing outreach, education, and technical support to current and prospective apprenticeship program sponsors and apprentices, has added 1,714 new apprentices and 66 new registered apprenticeship occupations statewide.

Apprenticeship programs provide employer-driven training to create a more productive, diverse, highly-skilled workforce for employers and help reduce employee turnover.

Job seekers gain increased skills, and a nationally-recognized credential to support future career advancement and increased wages.

2130,Staff,7/8/2017 7:11 AM,"Apprenticeships, on-the-job training, employment skills training and internships are all career skills programs that offer skills training opportunities to officer and enlisted service members preparing to transition from military to civilian employment.

""Career skills programs are vocational and technical training programs that focus on the practical application of learned skills and can lead to employment in a specific career or technical trade,"" said Ramona Franklin, an education services specialist at the Air Force Personnel Center.

""Training can take place up to six months prior to an Airman's separation.""

According to Franklin, the program is based on two driving principles: the Air Force will allow eligible Airmen to participate in industry training instead of performing military duties during the closing months of their careers, and industry training providers will offer training at little or no cost to eligible Airmen.

An Airman must have completed at least 180 days on active duty and be within 180 days of an approved retirement or separation in order to be eligible to participate in a CSP. Airmen must receive commander's approval to participate and the training opportunity must meet certain conditions.

""The program must offer a high probability of employment and be provided to the Airman at little or no cost, and should improve or broaden the Airman's skill by building on occupational skills learned while in service,"" Franklin.

""You can also choose a program that provides all new skills related to your goal for civilian employment.""

Commanders are encouraged to support career skills programs by identifying transitioning Airmen, ensuring maximum dissemination of information and supporting participation in the program when manpower and resources are sufficient to release the Airman.

""When possible, facilitating the smooth transition of Airmen into the civilian workforce fully employed is in the best interest of both the Air Force and each Airman,"" said Todd Usnik, the education operations business process owner.

Airmen may apply to participate in a CSP through self-nominations either after meeting with an education counselor or while attending the Transition Goals, Plans, Success Transition Assistance program.

Usnik recommends planning ahead for the transition to civilian life.

""Ideally, eligible Airmen should begin identifying potential programs and working with their education or TGPS counselor at least a year out from their separation date,"" Usnik said.

""For this reason, we send them a myPers message 12 months out to provide them a link to information about the programs.""

2146,Staff Report,8/11/2017 12:00 PM,"Apprenticeship programs jointly developed by community colleges and businesses ? and scaled up on a nationwide basis ? could go a long way toward closing the nation?s skills gap, according to U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.  ?Our job is to  ensure America?s workforce is prepared to meet the demands of a global and ever-changing economy,? Acosta told participants on Thursday at the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) board of directors? summer retreat in Washington, D.C.

AACC could be the ?perfect partner? to work on this effort, he said, and AACC President Walter Bumphus agreed to take up the challenge.  The unemployment rate is just 4.3 percent, the lowest it?s been in 17 years, Acosta said, yet there are many people not in the labor force because they lack the appropriate skills.  Seven million people are unemployed, while there are 6.2 million job openings. That mismatch is caused by an ?increasing gap between the skills the workforce demands and the education being offered by the college and university system,? he said."
2148,Press Release,8/11/2017 12:05 PM,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin today announced new legislation to boost workforce readiness by expanding apprenticeship programs and investing in public-private partnerships.  Senator Baldwin unveiled the PARTNERS (Pairing Apprenticeships with Regional Training Networks to meet Employer Requirements) Act today during a visit to Mid-State Technical College in Wisconsin Rapids.  ?In Wisconsin, I?ve seen how public-private partnerships can best address the workforce readiness challenges we face,? said Senator Baldwin. ?This new legislation will scale up our apprenticeship programs and provide more people with the skills they need to succeed. If we invest in public-private partnerships, we can boost workforce readiness and provide our businesses the skilled workers they need to grow our economy.?

Businesses?especially small and medium-sized businesses?often lack the infrastructure to establish apprenticeships or work-based learning programs on their own. Senator Baldwin?s legislation would address this challenge by establishing a program to provide states with grants that will help create or expand local public-private partnership apprenticeship initiatives.  With the PARTNERS Act, states would submit applications to the Secretary of Labor for local initiatives to start or expand apprenticeship programs. The state would then provide grants of up to $500,000 for two years to local public-private partnerships to bring industry and education partners together to start and run work-based training programs, as well as worker support services that help businesses develop apprenticeship initiatives."

2153,Staff,8/13/2017 1:32 AM,"Last February, President Donald Trump convened a group of manufacturing CEOs at the White House to discuss his administration's idea of growing American jobs by imposing a border adjusted tax.

As reported the next day, the BAT received lukewarm support at best, and unexpectedly, the CEOs instead pivoted the meeting toward the critical need to close the so-called skills gap preventing companies from filling high quality jobs with highly trained workers.

The next day, a national newspaper's headline read: ""Factory CEOs to Trump, 'Jobs Exist, Skills Don't.'"" Fast forward to the present: The BAT was declared dead by congressional leadership at the end of July, but the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 6.2 million job openings exist across the country, one of the highest levels on record.

Interestingly, one of the oldest and most effective solutions for closing the skills gap has deep connections to eastern Connecticut.

In 1937, my predecessor, U.S. Rep. William Fitzgerald of Norwich, authored the National Apprenticeship Act, also known as the Fitzgerald Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt.

The measure established national certification standards for apprenticeship programs in manufacturing and other sectors that have opened pathways to high-quality jobs for the last 80 years.

The Fitzgerald Act was the product of the real-life experience that Fitzgerald brought to Washington, having worked in a Connecticut foundry from an early age and later serving as an official in the Connecticut Department of Labor.

Fitzgerald knew, even in an era of less complex technology, that connecting workers to a job required consistent, high-quality job training.

That process begins in grade school, of course, but apprenticeship training is often the final step in achieving job readiness and positioning workers for success in their future careers.

When the Fitzgerald Act was passed in 1937, the United States was still slowly emerging from the Great Depression and new economic opportunities were few and far between for workers.

The value of the Fitzgerald Act became even more evident as the nation boosted factory production to unprecedented levels during World War II. Congressman Fitzgerald played a big part in that effort, too.

He left Congress after serving two terms and returned to Connecticut to head up the state's War Manpower Commission from 1942-1945.

As our state churned out plane engines, submarines and military uniforms in incredible numbers, Fitzgerald was guiding workforce programs to ensure our soldiers, sailors and airmen had the right tools to get the job done for the Allied Forces.

In recent years, eastern Connecticut has renewed the vision of Congressman Fitzgerald with a restart of apprenticeship training programs to fill job openings in a variety of occupations.

Apprenticeship slots are also being used in health care and information technology sectors where job openings are going unfilled because of the persistent nationwide skills gap.

With the demise of the BAT and the pause on advancements in trade policy, Congress would be well advised to listen to the message of the CEOs who visited the White House and strengthen job-training efforts across the country to close the skills gap.

They can do this by improving K-12 STEM education, bolstering tech schools and community colleges, and reinvigorating apprenticeship programs that former U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez described in a visit to Groton two years ago as the ""Gold standard"" of job training.

In the U.S. House of Representatives, the Republicans recently passed a budget out of committee that will zero out federal apprenticeship grant funding.

There is also an effort underway to weaken the Fitzgerald Act's national standards that have worked since it was first enacted back in 1937 and built the foundations of the U.S. war effort in World War II. Now is not the time to weaken job training.

We should be redoubling our efforts to follow the vision of the foundry worker who was sent to Congress 80 years ago from eastern Connecticut and who transformed the lives of millions of workers who never heard of him.

Let us join employers, employees, and skilled educators to build on Fitzgerald's legacy of training skilled workers and creating good jobs with good wages."

2164,Staff,8/15/2017 1:46 AM,"Bent on cutting costs and refocusing its portfolio, the company decided to close the plant that made bandages, knee braces and other health care supplies and move work to its plant in Mexico.

At 62, Mays is unemployed and wants to work, though on the face of it he has plenty of opportunities: Barely 10 miles from Mays' ranch-style brick home in this blue-collar city, GE Aviation has been expanding - and hiring.

In the state-of-the-art laboratory in a World War II-era building the size of 27 football fields, workers use breakthrough technology to build jet engines that run on less fuel at higher temperatures.

Bright flashes flare out as GE workers run tests with a robotic arm that can withstand 2,000 degrees.

The open jobs there are among 30,000 manufacturing positions available positions open across Ohio.

This is the paradox of American manufacturing jobs in 2017.

Donald Trump won the presidency in great measure because he pledged to stop American jobs and manufacturing from going overseas, winning Rust Belt votes from Mays and other blue-collar voters.

It's true that many jobs have gone overseas, to lower-wage workers.

At the same time, American manufacturers have actually added nearly a million jobs in the past seven years.

Labor statistics show nearly 390,000 such jobs open.

The problem? Many of these are not the same jobs that for decades sustained the working class.

More and more factory jobs now demand education, technical know-how or specialized skills.

Many of the workers set adrift from low-tech factories lack such qualifications.

Factories will need to fill 2 million jobs over the next decade, according to a forecast by Deloitte Consulting and the American Manufacturing Institute.

Workers are needed to run, operate and troubleshoot computer-directed machinery, including robots, and to maintain complex websites.

Last year, software developer was the second-most-common job advertised by manufacturing companies, behind only sales, according to data provided by Burning Glass Technologies, a company that analyzes labor market data.

Workers in many European and Asian countries are more likely to be working with robots than U.S. workers, studies show.

In such countries as Japan and Denmark, robotics and advanced automation have created solid jobs while increasing efficiencies for manufacturers.

Trump continues to make promises about adding U.S. manufacturing jobs.

In blue-collar Youngstown, Ohio, he talked about passing by big factories whose jobs ""Have left Ohio"" on his way to a July 25 rally, then told people not to sell their homes because the jobs are ""Coming back. They're all coming back.""

Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and a former U.S. trade representative, conceded in an interview: ""We're not going to see the kind of manufacturing renaissance that we all want in this country unless we focus on skills training.""

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, in a visit to a Detroit factory in June, acknowledged the need to address the skills gap by developing advanced computing skills.

""Apprenticeships teach striving Americans the skills they need to operate incredible machines,"" Trump said.

Of the 146 million jobs in the United States, only about 0.35 percent were filled by active apprentices in 2016.

Filling millions of open jobs through apprenticeships would require a substantial increase in government resources.

Apprenticeships are much more common at some European companies, notably German firms.

At Germany-based Stihl Inc.'s plant in Virginia Beach, Virginia, for example, A.J. Scherman is learning to be a ""Mechatronics technician."" Mechatronics combines electrical and mechanical engineering as well as computer skills.

Stihl makes chain saws, leaf blowers and weed trimmers at the factory.

Once he's completed his final year in Stihl's four-year apprenticeship program, Scherman will read diagnostic software on computer screens attached to each robot to repair and upgrade them.

Skip Johnson, Stihl's apprenticeship coordinator, said it's critically important to bring bright students into the plant, where they can see that the grime and dust they associate with factories are giving way to clean operations using futuristic technology.

U.S. manufacturing workers, excluding managers, make an average of $44,000 a year, according to government data.

That's just 2.8 percent higher, adjusted for inflation, than a decade ago after years of shifting of jobs overseas or to nonunion states.

Festo Didactic, the education arm of Germany-based Festo, last year launched two-year mechatronics apprenticeship programs in Ohio with Sinclair Community College, and is already expanding its U.S. apprenticeship offerings.

At Festo's plant in Mason, workers monitor a robotic distribution system that self-adjusts its work flow to prevent backups.

""This kind of factory has nothing to do with the factory we knew in the 1960s or 1980 or even 2000,"" said Yannick Schilly, who heads global supply for Festo's North American business.

There's not much demand locally these days for the kind of repetitive tasks done in those factories by workers such as Herbie Mays.

""He acknowledged that there are""plenty of jobs out here.

This is part of the first installment of Future of Work, an Associated Press series that will explore how workplaces across the U.S. and the world are being transformed by technology and global pressures.

As more employers move, shrink or revamp their work sites, many employees are struggling to adapt.

At the same time, workers with in-demand skills or knowledge are benefiting."
2166,By Jaimy Jones,8/15/2017 3:37 PM,"Career training is getting a jolt this fall with the start of a new electrician apprenticeship offered to junior and senior students at Spring Branch area high schools that will allow them to complete two of the four required years toward a professional journeyman's license, all before graduation.

The program is a first of its kind in the state, according to education consultants working to blend resources from the school district, industry partners and grant funding to help improve opportunities for low-income students while filling a need in the state's economy for skilled workers.

""There was a gap between the millenial and the baby boomer; there was no experience or their hands were too old,"" said Shane Murphy, a superintendent and school manager at TRIO Electric, the private company in East Spring Branch who approached the district about expanding their existing apprenticeship program to high schoolers due to a lack of qualified workers in the field.

The program will allow students to be on track to sit for a journeyman's electrician exam with the state of Texas only two years after high school, while simultaneously earning well above minimum wage with their level-one certificate earned at the end of the high school course.

First-year journeymen earn a median income of $52,000 annually, compared to the national average median income of $37,000 across all industries according to a 2016 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey from the United States Department of Labor.

Even for those students who have aspirations to earn a four-year degree, the pilot program will also confer college credit hours transferable to Houston Community College, which will certify their level-one certificate.

Murphy and Beau Pollock, TRIO president, have expressed a need for electrical engineers too, and hope to hire from the pool who come through the program once they finish college.

The initiative came together quickly, and TRIO and Spring Branch ISD made presentations at every high school to recruit students into the program, and held open houses for students and parents who were interested.

""It's really a win-win for the partnerships and the kids because we were able to identify about 50 juniors this year, and when they get to be seniors, we'll identify 50 more juniors,"" said David Sablatura director of Spring Branch's Career and Technical Education Center located at the Guthrie Center on Hammerly Road, where the hands-on learning will take place.

A $50,000 renovation is hurriedly being completed to outfit the room with training modules that mimic the classroom at TRIO. ""This is a school-to-work program, and for some families, they're seeing this as a great way for their kids to move into a career and start early,"" said Sablatura.

""A lot of those apprenticeships are hard to come by. We're really excited about it and we can't wait to get started; we're just weeks away from kicking it off.""

At least one student from each Spring Branch district high school has signed up for the electrical courses for the fall semester.

It starts with classroom lessons at Guthrie, then; over the summer, TRIO offers paid internships for students at $13 per hour, but more importantly, keeps the clock ticking toward the 2,000 hours of hands-on training to be completed by graduation.

TRIO is a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation-approved Apprenticeship site and has been providing the program to high school graduates for four years in their ""Boot camp""-style classes.

They hope training high schoolers will help them create a workforce for the entire state.

They predict being able to hire all 50 students who complete the inaugural class, and after that they'll help with job placement at other companies who face the same labor shortage.

A National Association of Home Builders 2016 survey found, ""The share of builders reporting either some or a serious shortage has skyrocketed from a low of 21 percent in 2012, to 46 percent in 2014, 52 percent in 2015, and now 56 percent in 2016. The shortages have harmed builders' abilities to both form their own workforces, and hire subcontractors, such as bricklayers and electricians.""

The survey concluded that the labor shortage has been a factor in rising home prices.

The implications of stimulating a sluggish workforce that could affect home prices, a major economic lever, has piqued the interest of one graduate student at University of Houston who is using the program as a research project.

Victoria Doan has been privy to high-level meetings and conference calls, and Laurie Bricker, an education consultant working with the partners, hopes Doan's research will provide data and validation along the way so that initiatives like this can be modeled across the state, and even the country.

""We want to make sure students stay engaged, not just looking at a textbook,"" said Murphy.

""We really want to train leaders.""

""A National Association of Homebuilders 2016 survey found,""The share of builders reporting either some or a serious shortage has skyrocketed from a low of 21 percent in 2012, to 46 percent in 2014, 52 percent in 2015, and now 56 percent in 2016."

2168,ANNALISE FRANK,8/16/2017 1:36 PM,"Construction on Little Caesars Arena and other developments in the 50-block District Detroit has created 673 apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeships since April 2015, Olympia Development of Michigan announced Tuesday.

This is the first time the organization has reported total apprenticeship numbers for the mixed-use development, Ed Saenz, manager of communications and media relations for the Ilitch family-owned Olympia Development, said in an email.

More than 350 of the skilled trade apprentices are Detroit residents, Saenz said.

The apprentices have worked with hundreds of Detroit- and Michigan-based contractors, according to a news release.

About 61 percent of contracts awarded for The District Detroit have gone to Detroit-based companies and 94 percent have gone to companies based in Michigan.

The Ilitch organization expects The District Detroit to create hundreds more apprentice positions ""In the coming years,"" it said in the release.

Construction projects in the area include Little Caesars Arena, set to open Sept. 12, the new Little Caesars world headquarters and parking decks.

An assortment of retail and restaurants are also in the works.

The District Detroit project, worth $1.2 billion, is expected to create 12,500 construction-related jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs, the release said.

The development's economic impact is expected to reach $2 billion by 2020, according to data from the University of Michigan.

""The District Detroit continues to provide great employment opportunities for Detroiters,"" Nicole Stallings, deputy director of workforce development for the city of Detroit, said in the release.

""The apprenticeships in particular are helping to train residents and prepare them for careers in the skilled trades. With the construction boom the city is continuing to experience, we expect there to be an abundance of opportunities for years to come.""

Apprenticeship and learn-while-you-work programs for skilled trades have faced difficulties recently, due to a lack of interest, Crain's has reported.

Training efforts are still underway with organizations including Operating Engineers 324, whose first class of Detroit high school students will graduate Thursday from its Workforce of the Future and Career Readiness Coalition training program.

Contractors on the Little Caesars Arena project signed an agreement with city officials requiring them to maintain an employment base of 51 percent Detroit residents or face fines.

Apprentices count toward the requirement, according to an emailed statement from the city's director of human rights, Portia Roberson.

Arena contractors have paid about $2.97 million in fines to the city as of March, according to the statement from Roberson.

Contractors say they have not been able to reach the requirement due a lack of qualified workers available in the city."
2170,Rep. Rosa Delauro (d-c,8/16/2017 12:29 PM,"The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on.

Too often, they lack the skills and experience to access better jobs and earn family-sustaining wages.

Our policymaking should increase opportunities for people to develop in-demand skills and credentials that help people get good jobs with rising incomes.

The fact is, by 2020, two out of three jobs will require education and training beyond the high school level.

It is up to us to use our resources to meet this need and help all Americans succeed.

It is critical for our competitiveness-and for our leadership in global innovation-to have a pipeline of skilled workers.

We must adapt and develop a strong, public workforce development system that meets businesses' changing needs.

The federal government has long played a key role in helping Americans workers learn and grow through workforce development and connecting businesses with talent.

Work-based learning and apprenticeship programs are equipping people with lucrative skills.

Apprenticeships enable companies to build a pipeline of skilled workers with customized skills, while apprentices learn a lucrative trade.

Across the country, 80,000 industries and companies offer registered apprenticeship training to 500,000 apprentices.

The need for apprenticeships is stronger now than ever before.

That is why it is baffling that House Republicans have completely defunded the Department of Labor's Apprenticeship Grant Program.

This cut will have a profound negative impact for employers-who will not have highly-skilled workers ready to fill vacancies-and for job seekers, who will lose a critical resource for job training.

During the Labor-HHS Appropriations markup, I offered an Amendment to restore $95 million to Apprenticeship Grants.

These grants present a key opportunity to connect job-seekers with the business community.

At a time when workforce investment is critical for the economic security of the working class, we cannot eliminate this critical tool we have to give people the skills they need to thrive in the workforce.

We need to enact policy that ensures that everyone can benefit from the economic recovery.

During the Department of Labor budget hearing with President Trump's, secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta testified that: ""It's a proven strategy that works. High quality apprenticeships and the emphasis on high quality enable workers to be involved in the training of their future workforce so that they can be sure that new hires possess the skills that are needed for the job.""

He went on: ""Apprentices receive wages and just as importantly skills. And along the way they earn while they learn. And that is just as important because that means they are not saddled with debt. Apprentices earn nationally recognized certificates of completion leading to long-term career opportunities."" Labor secretaries under Democrat and Republican administrations agree that apprenticeships are a valuable investment in our economic future.

We cannot pull back on our recent investments in apprenticeships, which have a solid return on investment.

International studies suggest that for every dollar spent on an apprenticeship, employers get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity and innovation.

At 500,000-the current number of apprenticeships represents only a sliver of the labor force.

To be at the same level as Germany, we would need 16 times as many new apprentices.

If we are serious about creating a better deal for American workers, we need to increase the number of apprenticeships in this country, not slash resources for programs that grow good-paying jobs across the country.

2173,Staff Report,8/17/2017  12:00 AM,"Rockdale County Public Schools (RCPS) and Rockdale Career Academy (RCA) are proud to announce the launch of an innovative German-style apprenticeship program under the Georgia Consortium for Advanced Technical Training (GA CATT), beginning with four students at the local branches of two German manufacturing companies.  These four sophomores ? Stanley Odom of Salem High, Toby Lanier of Rockdale County High, Alex Spencer of Heritage High, and T.J. Hayes of Rockdale County High ? signed letters of commitment to the three-year Industrial Mechanic Apprenticeship program during a Aug. 14 signing ceremony at the state Capitol. Odom and Lanier will apprentice at Haver & Boeker under the mentorship of Executive Vice President Claudio Caobianco and Spencer and Hayes will apprentice at Bosch under the mentorship of General Manager Bruno Oberle.

Apprentices are dual-enrolled students, splitting time between high school, technical college and a local manufacturing plant. By the end of the three years, students graduate with a high school diploma, progress towards an Associate?s degree, receive a U.S. Department of Labor Apprenticeship certificate, German-American Chamber of Commerce certification as an Industrial Mechanic, and earn between $20,000 to $25,000 while learning. The program is effectively a $40,000 scholarship as the Georgia Piedmont Technical College degree program is fully paid by the state and the training costs for the apprenticeship is borne by the company.  At the signing ceremony hosted by Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle?s office, the German American Chambers of Commerce, Technical College System of Georgia, and the Georgia College and Career Academies, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle thanked the school systems, companies, agencies, partners and individuals involved in establishing and growing the apprenticeship program. ?These partners continue to revolutionize the way our students are entering the workforce as skilled employees, driving the economy in their region. We are very proud of how it?s going to impact the entire state as well,? said Cagle. ?I believe that when we connect to make sure education is aligned with what industry needs truly are, we will have better outcomes.?"

2178,Associated Press,8/17/2017 2:30 PM,"Six months into her tenure as head of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon sees a split among small business owners - they are increasingly optimistic, she says, but many are held back by their inability to get loans or find the right workers for jobs that are staying open.

""Entrepreneurs are willing again to be bigger risk-takers than they have been over the past eight years,"" McMahon said in a phone interview this week with The Associated Press.

She said, there are also lingering effects of the Great Recession, and ""I think there is still a caution.""

McMahon's observations matched owners' self-assessments in surveys including ones released by Pepperdine University's Graziadio School of Business and Management and Dun & Bradstreet Corp. and by the National Federation of Independent Business.

She also named some of the stumbling blocks that many owners have cited in addition to a scarcity of loans and workers: regulations, taxes and the cost of health care, all issues President Donald Trump has pledged to address.

McMahon has spent the past six months traveling around the country, meeting owners at their companies and events like forums and roundtables.

She came to the SBA after being a big donor to the Republican Party and two unsuccessful runs for the Senate from Connecticut.

She has a background in business; she and her husband, Vince, founded and built World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., now a publicly traded sports entertainment company.

She resigned as CEO in 2009 and last year co-founded Women's Leadership LIVE, which promotes opportunities for women in business and public service.

Although small businesses are hiring more now than during the recession, many are conservative, not wanting to add staffers unless they have enough new business to justify expanding their payrolls.

McMahon echoed the feeling of many: They can't find workers with the skills to match their companies' needs.

Jobs for skilled workers like carpenters, electricians and welders are going unfilled, as are technology positions like computer code writers, McMahon said.

Companies that provide services like heating, ventilation and air conditioning are struggling to find workers to install and repair equipment.

""There's a lack of interest, or there is not a trained workforce to come in,"" McMahon said, adding that at many companies, skilled workers are age 50 to 55.

Owners are telling her, ""I don't have that next group that's going to take over these jobs.""

Another factor in the worker shortage is an unemployment rate that's at a 16-year-low of 4.3 percent - there are fewer people looking for jobs.

Workers may also be harder to come by if legislation to restrict immigration, a bill backed by Trump, becomes law.

A study released by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School projected that if the bill becomes law, domestic workers won't fill all the jobs that have been held by immigrants who would no longer be allowed in the U.S. Some solutions are coming from companies ranging from large ones like Boeing to small manufacturers that have been donating money, equipment or expertise to community college and high school students to train them for such jobs, McMahon says.

This continues a trend in place for decades, though.

In 1988 the Commission on the Future of Community Colleges recommended that community colleges work with companies to train students with the aim of their getting jobs upon graduation, and schools across the country subsequently began working with employers on training programs.

McMahon believes that training will lead to entrepreneurship: ""When you get those skills, you can start your own business.""

She pointed to an executive order Trump signed in June that roughly doubled to $200 million the taxpayer money allocated to learn-and-earn programs under a grant system called ApprenticeshipUSA. The money was to come from existing job training programs rather than a new line in the proposed federal budget, which would slash funding for the Labor Department's job training programs by a third.

SMALL BUSINESS LENDING. Small businesses, particularly the youngest, tiniest and those owned by women and minorities, have historically had a hard time getting loans.

Trump's steps to roll back parts of the financial regulation law known as Dodd-Frank would help banks lend more to small businesses, McMahon said.

A report issued by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in June proposed relaxing some of Dodd-Frank's requirements, including those on smaller banks.

The community banking industry and some small business advocates have said that the law, enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis, has imposed regulations on small banks that make it harder for them to lend to small companies, and to stay in business themselves.

Supporters of Dodd-Frank want to keep the law on the books to ensure that banks cannot engage in the lending and investing practices that led to the collapse of hundreds of financial institutions including big investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.

Lending to small businesses has improved since the worst days of the recession; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. counted $331 billion in commercial and industrial bank loans under $1 million as of Dec. 31, the most recent figures available.

Lending dropped to a low of $279 billion at the end of September 2012.

The Pepperdine-Dun & Bradstreet survey found that only about a third of companies with revenue under $5 million were successful in getting bank loans in the first four months of the year.

McMahon acknowledged that banks need to better serve the needs of women and minority business owners.

The administration is ""Making sure that our lenders understand what our expectations are relative to having women and minorities on equal footing when they come in"" to apply for loans, she said.

Women business owners need to be better advocates for themselves, McMahon said.

""We've found that women aren't as aggressive at promoting themselves and putting themselves forward as men, although more women are starting businesses and having a better success rate,"" she said.

Many owners including women need help in developing their business plans, and McMahon noted they can look for help from SBA-sponsored programs including Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers and SCORE, the organization that gives free counseling to small companies.

Trump's proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 cuts the SBA's appropriation by nearly 5 percent from the current level.

McMahon said that won't affect the agency's ability to help small businesses.

""We've looked at our programs across the board and we found that had some duplication in our programs. We also have some workforce positions that had not been filled and we're not going to fill,"" she said.

""It won't impact the effectiveness of the SBA to be doing the programs it should be doing."""

2183,Philip Gruber,8/18/2017 12:00 PM,"ROCK SPRINGS, Pa. - Pennsylvania's proposed training program for technicians who service farm equipment is inching closer to reality.

The state Department of Agriculture hopes to roll out the apprenticeship in October, two years after announcing that it was working with dealers and manufacturers to develop the program.

The apprenticeship will create a formal career path for a job that doesn't currently have one, and it could make it easier for dealers to hire and develop hard-to-find talent.

Through a mix of classroom and on-the-job training, apprentices will learn how to work on all kinds of farm machinery - gas and diesel engines, hydraulics, planting and harvesting implements, welding, and precision ag products.

They would also be trained in the math, science and safety needed for the job.

Chris Weller, an ag education consultant developing the apprenticeship curriculum for the Ag Department, looked at competencies required by other apprenticeships and asked equipment dealers what they wanted to see in the program.

The dealers suggested adding interpersonal and critical thinking skills to the curriculum, Weller said.

The apprentice will be an employee of the equipment business, not a part-timer or an intern, and will continue as an employee after completing the course.

Most apprenticeships are hours-based, meaning a worker gets credit after spending a certain number of hours practicing a certain task.

The service technician apprenticeship will be competency based, meaning a participant gets credit after demonstrating proficiency in a task.

Apprentices will complete the program at their own pace, some faster than others, Weller said.

Most apprenticeships run three to four years, though the minimum length is a year, said Scott Sheely, special assistant for workforce development at the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

High school ag mechanics classes and FFA supervised agricultural experiences could count toward part of the training, Sheely said.

That makes it easy for high-schoolers to move into the apprenticeship after graduation, but adults who are already out of school will also be welcome in the program, he said.

Sheely has been looking to use existing resources where possible, approaching Reading Area Community College and other technical schools to provide some of the coursework for algebra, fluid power and the like.

The state currently has four dealer partners - Binkley & Hurst, Deer Country, Hoober and Messick's - and one manufacturer partner, New Holland Agriculture.

The hub of the state's ag services industry is also home to many high school ag programs, so ""It's the easiest place to start,"" said Tim Wentz, field services director for the Northeast Equipment Dealers Association.

He will be the administrative coordinator for the apprenticeship.

From Lancaster, the apprenticeship could expand to dealers across the state.

""They all have trouble finding people,"" Sheely said.

Wentz said one dealer told him he is missing out on service and parts business because he cannot find enough technicians to do the work.

Being able to provide that service after the sale makes it a lot easier to sell a piece of machinery too.

""The customer values that relationship and that knowledge,"" Wentz said.

Sheely expects competition for apprenticeship slots.

The challenge for the dealers could be holding onto their employees once they have completed the apprentice training, he said.

He hopes to file the application with the state Department of Labor and Industry by the end of the month.

In Pennsylvania, the state Labor Department approves apprenticeships on behalf of the federal government.

Once the apprenticeship is approved, government money would be available to help the employer with the expenses of the apprenticeship.

The service technician apprenticeship is part of a small but growing push to formalize training for agricultural careers.

Last week, the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture announced it will launch a diversified vegetable apprenticeship.

The program would give farmers a way to develop management-level workers, said Dan Dalton, the group's Three Rivers Hub manager.

PASA is working with land-grant universities and organic farming groups to develop the curriculum.

The vegetable program was inspired by the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship, a national program that PASA administers in Pennsylvania.

Sheely said he is looking at the possibility of developing apprenticeships for other skilled ag jobs in short supply, such as meat cutting."

2190,Staff,8/2/2017 1:02 PM,"WASHINGTON-In anticipation of federal action on substantive infrastructure investments, the American Federation of Teachers, in conjunction with North America's Building Trades Unions, is acting now to ensure high school kids have the information, training and resources to rebuild our nation.

The AFT and NABTU have forged a nationwide partnership to jointly promote apprenticeships and develop and distribute information to guidance counselors to advance career and technical education in both CTE and non-CTE schools.

The two unions, representing millions of members across the education and trade sectors, will collaborate in the drafting of K-12 curriculum and lesson plans to help students build their careers.

Many CTE students, parents and educators are unaware of the opportunities for registered apprenticeships and middle-class careers in the building trades.

The novel program connects two high-quality education opportunities: our nation's CTE schools and the building trades' registered apprenticeship programs.

This partnership will help spread the word to U.S. high school students about the direct link between CTE and career opportunities in infrastructure construction projects, many of which are supported by teachers' or building trades' pension funds.

The program will be informed by NABTU's Multi-Craft Core Curriculum, a comprehensive pre-apprenticeship curriculum that was awarded the U.S. Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship Innovator and Trailblazer Award.

The collaboration kicked off at the recent AFT summer TEACH conference for educators, where attendees got to try out the latest virtual reality training platform used to teach apprentices real-world crane operation and control skills.

Teachers came away with a strong appreciation for the range of modern apprenticeships that the building trades offer.

""AFT President Randi Weingarten said:""Millions of American high school students are eager to learn the valuable skills necessary to be the builders of our roads, bridges, airports, schools and energy grids.

They aspire to careers rebuilding our nation-and the AFT, alongside NABTU, is turning that aspiration into action.

""At schools like Transit Tech in Brooklyn, N.Y., a CTE-focused education leads directly to apprenticeships and good jobs. At the same time, many public pension funds are invested in rebuilding America's infrastructure. Working together, we can train the next generation for great jobs, while using pension funds to help create those jobs. That helps fuel an economy that works for all.""

NABTU President Sean McGarvey said: ""We are thrilled to be partners with the AFT in this exciting initiative to develop the skilled workforce of the future via the advancement of career and technical education in America's public schools. As our nation gets set to embark upon the rebuilding and repair of our critical infrastructure systems, this partnership will be at the forefront of making sure that career training opportunities, via apprenticeship-readiness and formal apprenticeship education and training, are an integral part of the equation."""

2201,Calvin Harper,8/21/2017 6:00 PM,"Apprenticeship is an approach to training the next generation of practitioners of a trade or profession primarily through on-the-job application of their skills under the close supervision of an experienced craftsman.  The idea is as old as human civilization, but became systematized during the later Middle Ages after famine and the Black Plague killed off half of the population of Europe and drastically increased the value of labor. There have been a number of tweaks across time, but that form of apprenticeship is re-emerging in 2017 ? more about that in a second.

With an increased value in their labor, thousands of peasants began moving between principalities and kingdoms in pursuit of the same thing almost all people want ? more money and a better standard of living. Of course, it helped to be a skilled worker such as a mason, glazier, cooper, carpenter, blacksmith, butcher, or baker. In response, trade guilds arose in towns and cities as a means of ensuring that those claiming to offer ?skilled labor? were indeed skilled.  It was a simple process: An established citizen with a successful record in a trade ? a master craftsman ? would take on young people as an inexpensive form of labor and, over time, train them in the craft. In return for their labor, the master craftsman would provide food and lodging."

They note, interestingly, the average beekeeper is in their 50s. So, in an effort to bring younger kids into the industry the OCBA has created a program specifically tailored for youth up to the age of 18. This apprenticeship program offers education under the leadership of a mentor. The only thing those who participate need to supply is the protective equipment or gloves and veil. Bee boxes, bottom boards, inner covers, outer covers, frames for the bees to build on, smokers, hive tools, and of course the bees are supplied.

By doing so, it gives our youth a better opportunity to really learn and not stress about costs explained Eric Talley, the immediate past president. He helps oversee the educational portion of the Onslow County Beekeepers Association and administers the apprenticeship program.  ?We are a bunch of beekeepers who work to promote and encourage beekeeping here in Onslow County.

The Newton County School System (NCSS) and Rockdale County Public Schools have worked with several area businesses as well as other organizations to offer this opportunity. The first local German apprentices began their experience with the start of school this fall.  To get the NCSS?s perspective on this new program, the Covington News recently interviewed Tim Schmitt, NCSS?s director of career technical and agricultural education and workforce innovation.

Schmitt: For right now we are calling it our ?German Apprenticeship Industrial Maintenance Program.? The premise is that a German apprenticeship starts with 10th grade students and matches them through an interview process with a company that agrees to take them on as an apprentice for three years during tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade. And, while they are doing that, the students also dual enroll in Georgia Piedmont Technical College?s (GPTC?s) industrial maintenance program.  We are building the program as we go. However, we know there is 100 years of proven success in Germany, so we know it is a good model.

2232,Marla Rose,8/28/2017 3:52 PM,"Ohio is experiencing a more-severe construction-worker shortage than the nation as a whole, according to a survey released Monday by the Associated General Contractors of America.

In a press conference in Columbus, the group's national spokesman, Brian Turmail, said 73 percent of Ohio construction firms report having trouble finding qualified workers, compared with 70 percent of construction firms nationally.

In Columbus, the hiring challenge could be even greater: Turmail said that for July, the Columbus metropolitan area added 4,300 construction jobs compared with the previous July.

That 11 percent increase ranks Columbus 26th among 358 metros across the country for the growth rate of construction jobs.

In the near term, Turmail said, a continued lack of qualified workers could mean fewer firms are able to bid on construction projects.

Longer-term, Turmail said the worker shortage could create a drag on the economy, because projects wouldn't be generating and supporting jobs that eventually result in consumer spending.

First, many in the baby-boom generation - the youngest boomers are now in their mid-50s - are now retiring.

Second, during the Great Recession that began in late 2007, construction workers who were unable to find jobs went into other fields such as energy and health care.

Construction was ""Among the first industries to lay off workers, and among the last to rehire,"" Turmail said.

Finally, he said, too few young people are entering the profession to make up for losses from the first two causes.

""We want to let young people know there are well-paying jobs waiting in construction,"" Turmail said.

He called on the Senate to pass the reauthorization of the Perkins Act, which would give greater decision-making and funding authority over career and technical training to the states.

The greatest need reported by Ohio construction firms was for hourly craft positions - skilled trades workers who specialize in areas such as carpentry and heavy-equipment operation.

Between 40 percent and 43 percent also reported having trouble finding workers to fill some salaried office positions and field positions such as estimators and project managers.

About half of those with unfilled positions said they had increased overtime hours in the past year as a result.

The Monday announcement was held at the Carpenters Apprenticeship Training Facility on the West Side, where about 450 students each year go through intensive training to learn the trade.

Vince Wright, training director for the Ohio program, said some students start the training straight out of high school, but the average age is about 25.

The facility, which was moved from the East Side four years ago, is one of four such apprenticeship facilities around the state.

In total, about 2,000 apprentices are going through the program at any given time."

2237,Staff,8/3/2017 10:09 PM,"With the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest in 15 years, state officials say Michigan has 100,000 jobs that are going begging.

That, coupled with new mandates to train hard-core unemployed people, means the outlook is brighter than ever for those thinking they'll never get a good job.

Think again, said Percy Johnson, a veteran GM pipe fitter and union volunteer at job fairs.

""This is a golden time now"" for such job seekers, Johnson said this week, as he promoted a recruiting fair Saturday in Detroit called ""Expungements, Pardons and Jobs."" It'll be from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. at UAW Local 22, 4300 Michigan Ave.At the fair will be job recruiters from nearly two dozen of what Johnson called ""Felony-friendly employers."" With construction jobs accelerating in Michigan, many such employers are desperate to lure people to construction trades, including those with criminal records - applicants they wouldn't have considered a generation ago, Johnson said.

More: Snyder holds out hope for future Foxconn plant in Michigan.

The training even accommodates those weak in basic reading and math skills, he said.

A Wayne County circuit judge is expected to counsel applicants on how to expunge, or wipe clean, their criminal records through legal filings.

Johnson said he's worried that not enough former inmates will hear about the opportunities.

""I'm going in barber shops, beauty shops. I've posted my flyers at a lot of businesses,"" he said.

For past job fairs, Johnson found recruits in churches, at neighborhood basketball games and by word of mouth, he said.

Felony-friendly employers include those with big state highway contracts, like Shelby Township-based Dan's Excavating, which recently hired Shandra Dunn, 44, of Detroit.

More: Detroit's Randolph Career and Tech Center to become flagship in skilled trades training.

Shandra Dunn, 44, of Detroit stands next to I-75 south of Detroit, where she's working as a laborer in one of several training programs for those with a felony on their records.

Dunn said she worries that not enough people in her shoes will hear of the training - and the good jobs it can lead to.

Dunn said she served eight years behind bars for assault with intent to murder.

Free in 2011, she said she thought she'd never find good-paying work again.

She worried about whether to reveal her past on job applications because, again and again, she faced rejections.

Dunn met Johnson at a job-seekers forum after a church service in Detroit, where he quickly imparted a key lesson: Don't ever lie.

Dunn breezed through a paid pre-apprenticeship course and now earns $22 an hour as a laborer on the Michigan Department of Transportation's giant Downriver highway project, helping to rebuild bridges on I-75 between Detroit and Southgate.

""My company trusts me to build the roads - imagine that!"" Dunn exclaimed this week during a break from the hot, dusty job she said she loves.

Shane Kuhn, 20, of Detroit has had numerous ups and downs in life, from dropping out of school in the 10th grade to ""Hanging out with criminals,"" he said.

After meeting Johnson through a key church connection - ""My grandma"" - he got his GED, has a part-time job and is headed toward, well, more ups and down: an elevator-repair apprenticeship, he said.

As Johnson points out, ""Hey, these are good jobs!"" Many blue-collar fields pay more than the U.S. median income of $44,000, and that's especially true for the construction trades, according to the U.S. Labor Department.

Curtis Daniels, 53, of Oak Park poses Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017 outside one of his favorite places - the apprenticeship school in Ferndale where he has learned carpentry skills while leaving behind his felony record.

Downright amazing is the success story that belongs to Curtis Daniels, 53, of Oak Park.

Daniels got out of prison in 2012 after serving ""25-plus years"" in Michigan's state prisons, he said.

""I was a gangster who made a wrong choice in life,"" then served time for second-degree murder, Daniels said.

While in prison, he earned a high-school equivalency diploma, then took skill-trades courses behind bars, he said.

Once out, ""I had many employers turn me down. I put everything on my ru00e9sumu00e9, you see,"" he said.

Still, he snared a couple of low-paying assembly jobs before attending a meeting at Focus: HOPE in Detroit, where a skilled-trades employer offered to sponsor him as an apprentice.

That led to landing in a program called Returning Citizens, run by the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights, the Detroit-based union of 14,000 carpenters and millwrights across Michigan.

""It's been three years now, and I'm four classes from being a journeyman,"" Daniels said proudly, standing Thursday outside the Detroit Carpentry Apprenticeship Training School in Ferndale.

The acceptance of his past by fellow union members has been a big boost to his morale, Daniels said.

""The Michigan Regional Carpenters are like my second family,"" he said."

The National Association of Publicly Funded Truck Driving Schools and Fastport Inc. are co-sponsoring a National Standard Registered Apprenticeship Program for Professional Truck Drivers. NAPFTDS represents 117 publicly funded schools from 37 states.

The program has a goal of hiring ?over 100,000 new apprentices in the next four years,? said Bill McLennan, CEO of Fastport. ?It is a competitive imperative for American businesses to embrace apprenticeship models.?  Dave Harrison, Fastport executive director of national apprenticeship, said, ?This public/private partnership between the Department of Labor and industry associations is a significant pathway to meaningful career opportunities.?  The old sentiment that a college degree guarantees a good job is ?flawed,? said Brad Bentley, Fastport president. ?Higher education has failed to provide the working class with marketable skills,? he said. ?That missing ingredient is apprenticeships.?"
2244,Melanie Willoughby,8/30/2017  3:00 AM,"Ideally, a business could hire someone right out of school or off the street to fill a job opening and get a new employee who has been properly trained for the position. Anyone who has tried to hire someone recently knows this is not the world in which we live. The need for skilled workers continues to grow, both in New Jersey and nationally, and that need has brought new life to an old idea ? apprenticeships.  New Jersey?s skilled labor shortage is one of the biggest. We have more job openings per-capita than any other state in the nation except one. It?s not just a lack of college graduates; many businesses have jobs that require specific technical skills that still require post-secondary education, just not a full bachelor?s degree.

An apprenticeship could help fill this void. It?s an on-the-job training program that allows an employee to learn a craft or trade while being employed and paid by the company or organization sponsoring the training. Most trade unions have apprenticeships, but now the idea is expanding to other types of businesses that need employees in the middle skill level. An employer does not need government permission to start an apprenticeship program, but any job that requires certification or a license will likely need to be a registered apprenticeship.  Federally registered programs appear to be expanding. In June, President Donald Trump signed an executive order increasing funding for the ApprenticeshipUSA grant program to $200 million and giving third parties, including businesses, more leeway to design training programs that will teach skills to those who are seeking jobs but do not have the right qualifications."
2247,Billy Jones Commentary,8/30/2017 10:12 AM,"As a legislator and an invested citizen of Upstate New York, one of my chief concerns is economic growth throughout the region.

The 115th Assembly District comprises all of Clinton and Franklin counties as well as four towns in St. Lawrence County.

Over the past few years, each of these three counties has seen an above-average unemployment rate.

In June, the New York Department of Labor reported that out of the 62 counties in the state, Clinton County ranked 47th, with a 5.4 percent unemployment rate; Franklin ranked 52nd at 5.6 percent; and St. Lawrence County ranked 62nd, with a staggering unemployment rate of nearly 7 percent.

With an increase in funding to projects for infrastructure, tourism and education in this year's state budget, we have an opportunity to create new jobs and improve our economy.

The North Country is home to hundreds of successful businesses, schools, farms, manufacturing plants, health-care facilities and many other employment industries.

A key component of the 2017-18 state budget is the Empire State Apprenticeship Program.

There are plenty of quality employment opportunities throughout our region; we need to provide our workforce with the tools and training they need to become successful in their careers.

The Apprenticeship Program will help close the skills gap and supply our industries with the highly skilled, qualified workers that they need.

In order to make improvements to higher-education institutions throughout New York state, the SUNY system received $100 million in capital funding.

Clinton Community College, SUNY Plattsburgh and all three community-college campuses in the North Country and will receive a portion of these funds to make modifications to their infrastructures.

These necessary updates will lead to job growth throughout the region.

It will also make our campus facilities safer and create a more beneficial learning environment for students.

Each year, cities, towns and municipalities look to make improvements to their roads, bridges and water systems.

This year's state budget increases funding for the Consolidated Local Street and Highway Program and Pave NY by $65 million to help local governments pay for road and bridge improvements without burdening taxpayers.

These additional funds will offer new employment opportunities, which will ensure that the North Country has safe and reliable infrastructure for years to come.

We could also see an increase in our region's economic development through the state's $70 million investment in the I Love New York program.

Each year, millions of people travel to Upstate New York to visit the Adirondack Mountains, Lake Champlain, AuSable Chasm, the St. Lawrence River and much more.

By promoting and improving our state parks, waterways and attractions throughout the North Country, it is likely that we will see a significant increase in tourism, leading to more professional opportunities and a stronger economy.

Given these funding increases, we now have to match our qualified workforce with the companies and organizations that require their skill set.

More than 50 employers from four counties set up booths in the Malone Middle School Gymnasium to talk to people about job requirements and possibilities.

The Middle School welcomed over 200 people from a variety of towns throughout the region.

Although this year's state budget has given our region many opportunities to reduce our unemployment rates through the creation of new jobs, economic growth does not happen overnight.

We must continue to work together to provide employment opportunities to those that seek them and advocate for the needs of the North Country."

An apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and related technical instruction under the supervision of a journey-level crafts person or trade professional. Apprentices learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a highly skilled occupation from a journeyman.

Many people still associate apprenticeships with careers in construction, electricity and plumbing.

While the list of projects they have completed is extremely impressive, Phaze Concrete prides themselves on employing a team of workers that carry the company's mission statement to the construction site.

To achieve this, they ensure all of their employees work together as part of a team so that everyone is committed to creating a professional and safe working atmosphere. Phaze Concrete's Experience Modification (EMOD) rating currently stands at 0.72%, which shows the commitment from the company and their workers.  Additionally, the company joined forces with the Department of Labor's Department of Apprenticeships, creating an exciting and unique work education program. The decision has been extremely successful, providing young people with the high-quality on-the-job training and instruction.  The importance of training has been highlighted by Alexander Acosta, United State Secretary of Labor, who attended the G-20 Late and Employment Ministers' Meeting in May of 2017. The White House Office of American Innovation is also equally committed to fostering and supporting apprenticeships. "
2272,Patrick Gillespie,8/8/2017 1:21 PM,"NEW YORK - American employers are trying to hire, but they can't find the right workers for the right price.

The U.S. boasted 6.2 million job openings in June, a record level, according to a Labor Department report published on Tuesday.

The high number of job openings illustrates a strength and a weakness of the U.S. job market.

On the good side, American employers are ready to hire.

During the Great Recession, job openings plunged to as low as 2.2 million in 2009.

The Labor Department began tracking open positions in 2000.

On the downside, employers increasingly say they can't find skilled and available workers to fill their open positions.

A growing debate has emerged among economists: Some say American workers need better skills while others argue that employers need to offer higher wages to attract better talent.

Regardless, job openings are abundant in several industries.

There were 388,000 manufacturing job openings in June, 225,000 construction postings and even 23,000 unfilled mining jobs.

Each of these industries was up compared to the previous month and compared to a year ago.

Schools and hospitals have the most job openings: There were 1.2 million postings in health and education services in June.

President Trump hopes to fill some of those open jobs by investing more in apprenticeship programs, which tend to be located at offices or factories.

Administration officials announced in June they would put $200 million toward ApprenticeshipUSA, a grant program, using already-allocated Labor Department funds.

Trump's proposed budget seeks to significantly cut funding for job training programs that offer more classroom-based learning.

The budget would reduce funding for job training by $1.1 billion, or 40%. U.S. officials say job training programs have had checkered success.

Some programs considered to be thriving are asking the administration to reconsider."
2274,Elizabeth Redden,8/8/2017 10:08 AM,"David Whalen was a junior in high school when he learned about an apprenticeship program at the Siemens factory in Charlotte, N.C., which manufactures generators and turbines.

He graduated from Central Piedmont in May and will finish the four-year apprenticeship this summer, after which he plans to stay on at Siemens.

""It does have its ups and downs,"" Whalen said of the apprenticeship experience.

""I know for a fact that I can get through this apprenticeship program and still have a job and keep working as long as I want,"" Whalen said.

As the U.S. has pushed to grow apprenticeship programs in recent years, German companies like Siemens have been at the forefront.

Many credit Germany's apprenticeship program for being a key factor in the country's relatively low youth unemployment rate.

""So we turned to our colleagues in Germany, which has a very proven apprenticeship model, and tried to figure out how best to apply it in a country as diverse as the United States,"" Marks said.

Siemens now has apprenticeship programs, all in partnership with community colleges, at its locations in Alabama, California and Georgia, in addition to North Carolina, and plans to start programs in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas.

Apprenticeships are often discussed as a way to bridge the ""Skills gap,"" in particular the gap in so-called middle skills, those that require more than a high school education and less than a four-year degree.

Most apprenticeships in the U.S. have traditionally been in the building and construction trades, but there is increasing interest in expanding them into other fields like advanced manufacturing, information technology and health care.

Broadly speaking, apprenticeships enjoy bipartisan support.

The Obama administration directed roughly $250 million to expanding apprenticeships.

In June, President Trump signed an executive order seeking to expand apprenticeships ""While easing the regulatory burden on such programs"" and carving out a larger role for industry groups and unions in certifying their quality.

Advocates for apprenticeship programs welcomed Trump's focus on the subject but expressed concerns about the possible easing of wage and quality control standards that are in place for registered apprenticeship programs, which are administered by the Department of Labor and various state apprenticeship agencies.

They also pointed out that the president's push for apprenticeships - and up to $200 million in possible funding for this purpose - came at the same time he had proposed cuts to other work force and technical education programs in his budget.

As interest in the apprenticeship model has grown, both the German and the Swiss governments - Switzerland has a similar model - have gotten involved in actively exporting the concept.

Advocates for expanding apprenticeships stress that the models can't be imported wholesale and that the contexts for work and school differ vastly across the countries.

The German Embassy in Washington has been promoting apprenticeship programs through the government's skills initiative.

""There are a lot of challenges: companies must realize that it pays to assume responsibility in the same way as their German counterparts - this means financing and organizing the part of the apprenticeship that takes part in the company.""

The Swiss and U.S. governments entered into a formal agreement in 2015 to cooperate on supporting apprenticeships and other forms of vocational and educational education and training, at which time 18 Swiss companies announced plans to develop or expand apprenticeship programs in the U.S. As in the case of Germany, Switzerland's ambassador to the U.S., Martin Dahinden, said developing the labor force here was one of his country's motivations.

Various apprenticeship models in the U.S. have German or Swiss influence or roots.

In Chicago, the Midwestern branch of the German American Chambers of Commerce has established the Industry Consortium for Advanced Technical Training, or ICATT, a consortium of businesses that offer apprenticeship programs in partnership with community colleges.

Because many of the companies are small or midsize, the chamber centrally handles many administrative aspects of the programs, which feature a three-year apprenticeship followed by a two-year job guarantee.

Mario Kratsch, the director of the skills initiative at the German American Chambers of Commerce in Chicago, stressed the fact that the apprenticeship is combined with a two-year degree, after which a student can go on to a four-year education if they choose to.

""Everybody thinks that apprenticeship is preparation for a job,"" he said.

""It is not! What an apprenticeship is [is] a first step in a career pathway.""

""The beauty of the German model is it respects that fact that a person has to be educated on multiple fronts,"" said Antigone Sharris, the coordinator for the engineering technology program at Triton College, a community college in suburban Chicago that partners with ICATT. ""They don't just get a certificate and just know one thing. They're actually going to be a well-rounded individual. They're taking their gen eds with their tech classes and getting their associate degrees. And associate degrees have always been transferable.""

Eric A. Hanushek, an economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, has cautioned that apprenticeship programs may not always be the sort of win-win many suggest.

""Even if the U.S. succeeded in expanding apprenticeships, the problem of skill obsolescence remains,"" Hanushek wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in which he argued that Germany's apprenticeship system can't be easily replicated here - and that the German system has problems of its own.

In a 2015 study published in The Journal of Human Resources, Hanushek and three co-authors looked at labor outcomes across 11 countries and found evidence of a ""Clear trade-off"" between short-term and long-term labor outcomes for workers with general and vocational education, with that pattern being ""Most pronounced"" in countries with strong apprenticeship systems.

""The pattern is most pronounced in the apprenticeship countries of Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In these countries, the easier entry into the labor market is balanced by noticeably greater withdrawal at older ages.""

""What I worry about is that we have apprenticeship programs that solve the immediate problem, but as these people age and the world changes, they're unprepared to change.""

Hanushek said what he objects to isn't the training aspect of apprenticeships but rather the way they're being held up as a ""Band-Aid"" to deal with weaknesses in the school and higher education systems.

""[Trump] sort of says our current education and training systems are failing, we're going to move toward apprenticeships, an 'earn while you learn' system, and we'll just get around the fact that our general education is failing.

Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at New America, said it's hard to know how transferable the findings about other countries with large apprenticeship programs are to the American context.

Of apprenticeship programs, she said, ""You need them to have enough general academic skills in them that people can continue to build on them. That's probably more of a design question than something intrinsic about apprenticeship.""

""There are""two competing narratives"" surrounding apprenticeships, McCarthy said.

One is that apprenticeship is something you do rather than go to college.

College isn't for everyone; do an apprenticeship instead. ""The other message, though - and that would come more from the education reform community and groups like New America - is apprenticeship can be another form of college. It's a different modality of higher education and it should be delivered by the higher education community, like community colleges, and it should connect to bachelor's degrees. How can you make sure that an apprentice who's also getting an associate's degree can go on to get a bachelor's degree in engineering or applied engineering?"".

""It's two conversations,"" McCarthy continued, ""Both wanting to raise up apprenticeship as a high-quality alternative to traditional college, one more focused on it being a different modality of college and the other focused on it being just a pure alternative."""

There is no doubt we need to expand opportunities and increase the affordability of two-year and four-year degrees.

Higher education is essentially all the formal learning we do after high school.

Higher education is the bridge between high school to many careers.

A neglected component of higher education and our economy is apprenticeships.

They are key to building a highly skilled workforce and closing the skills gap.

As the Ranking Member of the House's Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, I believe there is a real opportunity to build on the success of effective programs and make apprenticeships even more of a valued option for young people.

More and more students say they are looking for more flexible education choices to meet their busy schedules.

We need to answer their call and make quality apprenticeships a viable possibility for all students.

Registered apprenticeships have been training students for quality, high-paying jobs for decades.

Many of these programs work with local community colleges to build and develop curriculum that allows apprentices to transition into other higher education pathways and high-paying jobs.

Apprenticeships must be prestigious enough to attract bright students.

Parents want to know their children are receiving a quality education with high standards that will lead to a prosperous future.

A number of successful apprenticeship programs are on display in San Diego.

When it comes to apprenticeships, the ones that come to mind are trades, such as welding or construction.

Did you know there are apprenticeships at San Diego Gas & Electric, San Diego Metropolitan Transit System and Solar Turbines that employees of these companies access to learn new skills? In August I had the opportunity to visit these companies and speak with their apprentices about what drew them to the programs.

Learning about these programs firsthand and discussing how we can encourage more young people to participate in earn-as-you-learn opportunities was invaluable.

Apprenticeships are not just a benefit to the apprentice, but they help companies recruit and train new employees.

I plan to take these ideas back to Congress to find ways to further promote apprenticeship programs.

I will be drafting legislation to increase funding for apprenticeships and ensure they are held to a high standard.

In addition to an increase in funding, my proposal would seek to expand the types of apprenticeships available and ensure these programs are led by industry partners in collaboration with local schools.

If taxpayers are going to invest in these important programs, there must be accountability for students and their families.

We have seen time and again that industries cannot self-regulate, and it is our responsibility to protect the interest of our students.

Apprenticeships can be made more appealing by expanding them beyond the traditional trades.

Companies must build upon the phenomenal work the building trades have done to open up apprenticeships in new industries.

By recognizing and rewarding companies who develop successful programs, we can incentivize more industries to expand apprenticeships across the country.

Success in this area means we have to engage with all of our partners in this effort.

Whether it is learning from the important work unions have done in this space, asking businesses to continue their engagement, or looking to schools and nonprofit organizations to develop meaningful curriculum for apprentices, we know this must be a collaborative process.

That's why it was so disappointing to see federal dollars for apprenticeship programs eliminated from a spending bill for labor programs.

These dollars in the past were used to promote diversity and support intermediaries so small businesses can benefit from apprenticeships.

Instead, we should expand these programs to encourage young people to take an ""Apprenticeship Summer"" - connecting them with local businesses to learn high-quality skills that are not offered by most high schools.

From my conversations with my colleagues on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I know apprenticeships have great support.

I hope we can come together in a bipartisan manner to expand apprenticeship programs and create multiple paths to higher education and good paying jobs."

The Ohio College Apprenticeship Consortium is made up of ApprenticeOhio, the entity overseeing the state's registered apprenticeship program, and 10 community colleges.

Participating students who finish pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship programs - in fields like advanced manufacturing, construction and health care that are identified as needs by local employers - will receive tuition reimbursement, according to the release.

The consortium is being funded by a $1.145 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor, received in December 2016, said Bret Crow, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, in an email.

The community colleges will offer classroom instruction, as well as services like marketing and outreach, while employers will provide employment, on-the-job training and wages to participants.

2342,Lynn Grooms Lgrooms@madison.com,9/25/2017 4:47 AM,"DEERBROOK, Wis. - Owning a dairy farm and keeping it a family farm that's what Matthew Keesling says he hopes to do.

Serving a dairy-grazing apprenticeship with master grazier Andy Bures of Bures Organic Dairy Farm near Deerbrook, Keesling is learning the path to that goal.

The two men participate in the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship, an accredited national program registered under the U.S. Department of Labor-Employment and Training Administration.

Keesling began his apprenticeship with Bures in June.

In the next two years he must complete 3,712 hours of employment and mentorship under Bures' direction.

The apprenticeship also calls for completing 288 hours of related instruction.

The men use the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship's ""Training Guidelines Handbook,"" which addresses all aspects of dairy grazing - from production to business practices.

""The material helps you to understand and make decisions, but it must be put into context on the farm for it to really sink in,"" Keesling said.

That's why the hands-on job at the Bures farm is important, he said.

Bures said, ""We've been discussing subjects from the handbook while we're milking and putting up feed for the winter. My job is to help Matt become comfortable about managing a farm for himself. His goal is to learn as much as he can.""

Bures has been farming since 1999, after attending college and graduate school, and serving in the U.S. Army.

He grew up on the family farm that he eventually purchased from his father, Robert Bures.

He currently has about 80 head of cattle, split about 50-50 between cows and young stock.

They are comprised mostly of Holstein genetics with some Jersey genetics introduced.

About 40 acres of the 150-acre farm is in permanent pasture.

The rest is grazed as needed, primarily during the second half of the summer.

When Andy Bures took over the operation, he introduced an intensive rotational-grazing system where cows are moved every day in small portable paddocks.

That gives grasses and legumes time to recover before they're grazed again.

""We have four 10-acre paddocks that are further divided into 28 paddocks,"" Bures said.

The grazing mix is primarily composed of bluegrass, white clover and timothy, with some red clover.

Bures also feeds grain as well as haylage and corn silage in the winter months.

Keesling said he has been surprised by the amount of feed an acre of land can produce.

""The only feed purchased is corn because we're too far north for the growing season.""

Keesling didn't grow up on a farm, but did work on crop and hog farms as a teenager in his hometown of Denison, Iowa.

He later earned a bachelor's degree from Kansas State University and then a master's degree in public administration from Webster University.

He served in the U.S. Army for 24 years and attained the rank of major.

He worked in the program at the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, and in Afghanistan.

""I've also served three tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan,"" he said.

Before retiring from the army in 2017, Keesling decided he wanted to work from home and always have something to do.

""I enjoy the animal-husbandry aspect of dairy and raising a herd to be healthy and productive as naturally as possible,"" he said.

""As I looked at ways to transition to dairy farming, I realized I didn't have the educational background or experience to gain financing through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Program. I began looking for courses I could take online while still on active duty, but didn't see myself learning how to farm solely from books and webinars. I found the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship online and posted my profile. I fielded several calls from master grazers and decided this was the path to take.""

""It's easy to take one piece of information and go down a rabbit hole,"" he said.

""I need to keep it all in perspective and know the larger aspect will keep me sane.""

""It's important to balance your life so that you don't become so absorbed in work that it becomes all you know,"" Bures said.

""You need vacations, other interests and time with family.""

Bures has three adult children, and Keesling has five children, four of whom are adults.

Because Bures' children don't work on the farm, he said he appreciates the help of his apprentice.

He also wants to help Keesling take the next steps to establish a viable family farm.

""I hope to own a dairy and bring my children into the business,"" Keesling said.

""I want to keep it small, but diverse so everyone is employed and that we remain a family farm."""

2363,Kevin Carey,9/28/2017 1:00 AM,"Last December, Destina Garcia found herself outside a locked front door in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Somewhere on the other side was an older man who needed her help.  She didn?t know yet that he had terminal cancer. She hadn?t met his estranged daughter, the one she would eventually bring north to spend the final days at her father?s side.  At that moment, Ms. Garcia was only a few weeks into a brand-new and also very old kind of job, one being modernized to help fix the broken American system of education, training and employment. She had just begun work as an apprentice.  President Trump has started a debate about whether it?s possible to vastly expand the number of apprenticeships nationwide without losing the elements that make them work best.  Then Ms. Garcia got connected to a new program jointly sponsored by Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, the New York Alliance for Careers in Health Care, LaGuardia Community College and the nation?s largest health care workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U. Using apprenticeships, the program trains people to become community health workers.

Apprenticeships have been around for ages. Ben Franklin and Paul Revere were apprentices. Since the Industrial Revolution, apprenticeship in America has been concentrated in areas like plumbing, welding and ironwork: male-dominated, blue-collar trades.  But the real growth in today?s job market is in fields like health care and technology. The number of community health workers, who connect vulnerable people to the medical and social service systems, increased to 51,900 in 2016 from 38,000 in 2013."
2365,Paul Marchand,9/28/2017 6:18 PM,"By 2020, our country will have almost two million veterans under the age of 34 who served in post 9/11 conflicts.

These men and women have paid our country a great service, and they have much to contribute when they return to the workforce.

Despite years of experience in the world's most technologically advanced military, there are U.S. veterans leaving the service unable to find a job.

Although the annual veteran unemployment rate is at a record low, it remains consistently above the overall unemployment rate for other workers.

Soldiers returning from World War II were able to harness the G.I. Bill to secure high-value jobs - with wages allowing them to fulfill the American dream and drive a new era of economic growth.

Today, we have both the obligation and the opportunity to tap into the vast skills of a new generation of returning soldiers and provide them the same opportunity afforded to the Greatest Generation by training and hiring them to be successfully employed in today's economy.

Registered Apprenticeship programs and on-the-job training can help veterans successfully transition from the military to a new career they can continue to proud of.

Certified by the U.S. Department of Labor, apprenticeship programs put veterans on a career track, with good benefits and opportunities for continued advancement.

GI Bill participants in these apprenticeship programs are eligible to receive tax-free GI benefits while also being paid by the company that has hired them.

Once the apprenticeship or training is complete, those who successfully complete the program receive national.

At Charter Communications, I've seen firsthand how these programs yield real-world benefits to a company and their veteran employees.

Today, about 13 percent of our company's workforce are veterans, and we are committed to increasing our overall veteran hiring by 5 percent by 2020.

A key initiative to hire, train and retain veterans in order to reach our goal is expanding Charter's Spectrum Broadband Technician Program to a national program available across our 41-state footprint.

Charter's program is certified by the U.S. Department of Labor and provides newly-hired Spectrum broadband techs the opportunity to receive Apprenticeship Certification.

Enrollees complete thousands of hours of on-the-job training and an extensive classroom curriculum up to four years.

Qualified veterans can secure GI benefits by while completing the program putting them in the position to earn tax free money in addition to their paycheck.

That is why I was excited to take part in Wednesday's hearing before the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity that examined ways to improve the certification process for GI Bill approved apprenticeship programs.

With government streamlining, apprenticeship programs could be even more effective.

In addition to certification by the USDOL, companies must obtain approval from states in order for enrolled veterans to be able to collect his or her GI Bill benefits.

As the requirements for state approval vary from state to state, federal and state agencies should consider harmonizing their processes and requirements.

Such streamlining would facilitate the expansion of apprenticeship programs nationwide and put more veterans to work more quickly.

After they leave active duty, we need to make sure they are put on a career path that can help them buy homes, send their children to college and fulfill the American dream.

With more men and women leaving the military every day, we don't have a moment to lose.

It is time for the private sector to step up and do its part.

2366,Globe Newswire,9/29/2017 10:41 AM,"National Park College began training for a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Apprenticeship Program last week.

The Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship recently approved the program in July 2017.

The College established the program with feedback from local HVAC contractors who expressed the need for an apprenticeship model of training.

""We really need employees that can work during the day and go to school at night,"" stated Jason Vincent of Grisham AireCare, who is currently serving as Chair of the NPC HVAC Apprenticeship Advisory Committee.

""The apprenticeship model is beneficial to newer employees because they are getting not only classroom knowledge but hands-on experience in the field that reinforces what they are learning.""

NPC decided to close its one-year HVAC technical certificate program after enrollment declined with plans to restructure the program to better meet the needs of local industry.

""We have been discussing the best format for this program with our local contractors for several months now, and everyone agreed that an apprenticeship model is the best way to ensure HVAC students receive the best possible training to prepare them for work in the field,"" stated Kelli Albrecht, Vice President for Workforce and Strategic Initiatives.

""We have received support from partners around the state, including our Department of Labor liaison, the state apprenticeship office, the state HVACR Association, and our local contractors.""

One unique aspect of this program is that pre-apprentices are allowed to participate in the classroom training, which means a student can begin classroom training before securing a job with a contractor.

Local employers hope to use the program as a recruitment tool to hire apprentices.

Other opportunities may be incorporated for high school juniors or seniors that are interested in a career in HVAC and could include evening classes and hands-on experience with local contractors during the summer.

Upon graduation, students could potentially work full-time while they complete the apprenticeship.

Currently, seven local HVAC contractors have agreed to send their newer employees to the HVAC Apprenticeship program, including Daniell Heat and Air, GTS, Grisham Air Care, City Plumbing, Heating and Electric, Climate Control Heating and Air Conditioning, Knox AC and Heating, and the Garland County Sheriff's Office.

The program may expand in the future to include more experienced employees that could benefit from a national credential.

""Once a student completes the training they receive a national credential from the Department of Labor,"" stated Albrecht.

""This credential will allow students to work in any state as an HVAC Technician.""

The apprenticeship model of training is a combination of on-the-job training and related instruction in which workers learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a highly skilled occupation.

Nationally, apprenticeship programs have been on an upward trend in recent years.

The U.S. Department of Labor reports that 1,700 new apprenticeship programs were established nationwide in FY 2016.

Arkansas has 88 active apprenticeship programs and saw 21 new programs in 2016 alone.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts demand for qualified, well-educated HVAC technicians will grow to grow 14 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations, according to BLS. The BLS expects the demand will be driven by commercial and residential building construction, the growing number of sophisticated climate-control systems, and increased emphasis on energy efficiency and pollution reduction.

Enrollment for the NPC HVAC Apprenticeship Program will be ongoing throughout the year.

Classes will be held on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Contact Community and Corporate Training for registration information at 501.760.4393 or 501.760.4135.

2374,"Chris Farrell, Elizabeth Shockman & Julie Siple",9/4/2017 11:59 PM,"For more than 120 years we have celebrated workers on Labor Day. This year labor is doing better, certainly compared to a decade ago during the Great Recession. The unemployment rate is 4.4 percent.  Yet there are still far too many people sitting on the sidelines of the job market, especially younger adults. Too many jobs offer low wages and bleak prospects for advancement.  Meanwhile, management routinely complains about not finding the skilled workers they need.

One intriguing way to expand opportunity and close the gap between people looking for good jobs and employers eager for skilled labor is for the U.S. to embrace apprenticeship programs. Think Germany and its famed apprenticeship system.  Apprenticeships combine several years of paid work with classroom instruction. Advocates argue that a vibrant apprenticeship system holds the promise of reducing youth unemployment, improving the transition from school to career, raising wages and boosting productivity.  At least, that's the promise.

2376,Donnette Beckett Herald & Review,9/4/2017 5:12 AM,"DECATUR - Shikia Green was 20 years old and working at a local convenience store when she heard about a free apprenticeship program.

Four years ago, Green figured out where the program office was located, met an instructor and was encouraged to apply.

She was accepted into the Homework Hangout's Pre-Apprenticeship Painting Program shortly after the meeting.

Although she expected to learn a trade, she also gained life skills.

During her first class, Green was asked, ""If you had $10,000, what would you do with it?"" Her answer was to invest it in her own business.

This was exactly what her instructor was looking for.

It is a free, six-month training program funded by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Green and the other students take part in demonstration classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

""We are given other things to think about, such as investment,"" Green said.

""How are you going to have your money work for you?"".

""We want people to come out of here employable,"" said Erik Grebner, Homework Hangout executive director.

The program focuses on the four building trades - painters, carpenters, plumbers and electricians.

The instructors are journeymen, retirees and others experienced in theose fields.

Dale Moyer, plumbing instructor and retired member of the Local 137, has taught his trade since 1994.

He joined the program in 2016 providing instruction that goes beyond plumbing.

He said math is one of the important classes for his students.

The students - also referred to as cohorts -spend their time in hands-on environments.

""We also coordinate with other trades.""

The apprenticeship program has several properties in the community in which cohorts can learn their trade.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, a crew can be found in one of the homes wiring, plumbing, painting and repairing.

""We are working with a group that hasn't had much work experience,"" Grebner said.

""Many come from being low-income to suddenly making money. They don't where to spend it. They don't know how to save.""

Money management is an important aspect of the class.

Grebner said trade employees are especially cautious of finances, because work is not consistent.

""It is important to save for when work is slower,"" he said.

After the program has been completed, the instructors will attempt to place cohorts in trade unions.

The ability to place them depends on the work available in the trade.

It began by training painters only with the apprenticeship funded by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

In 2016, the program's funding came from the U.S. Department of Labor and grew to include other trades.

The program directors place students from diverse groups - low-income and under-served populations such as women, minorities, offenders, disabled and veterans.

He found the Homework Hangout apprenticeship was more appropriate for what he wanted to do.

""Especially being able to speak to the instructors and ask questions.""

Knotts is in the plumbing and pipefitters apprenticeship.

His instructors allow him and the other students to do the work with assistance.

The academic classes also helped Knotts with his math skills and has helped him open up to other students in the trades.

Green was in the painters apprenticeship for a few weeks before she was approached to begin the operating engineers program.

""Wherever the opportunity is greater, that's where I'm going,"" she said.

In the painters union, employees are painting residential or commercial properties.

In Green's new program, employees are operating heavy machinery.

She suggests for those wanting to apply for the apprenticeship, be prepared to work."

2388,Roy Maurer Sep 7,9/8/2017 1:09 PM,"CHICAGO-Employers need to develop innovative education and training to close the skills gap, said CareerBuilder CEO Matt Ferguson.

He was speaking at Empower 2017, a CareerBuilder conference for recruiting professionals held by the end-to-end recruiting software company.

The low unemployment rate and a labor force participation rate that has not rebounded from reductions suffered during the Great Recession, plus a growing skills gap, have created a significant talent deficit as well as a hypercompetitive hiring environment.

Nearly 60 percent of employers have jobs that stay vacant for 12 weeks or longer.

The average cost HR managers say they incur for having extended job vacancies is more than $800,000 annually, according to CareerBuilder research.

""There are people without jobs and jobs without people,"" Ferguson said.

""Millions of companies are saying they can't find people with the right skills, and 36 percent of people in the workforce-over 50 million people-feel they are underemployed.""

Ferguson said that the labor participation rate should be at around 66 percent, similar to before the Great Recession, or even 67 percent, after 80 consecutive months of job growth, but instead it has fallen to where it was in 1977.

He added that the majority of growth in jobs and wages has been for roles with a high degree of analytical and social skills, while jobs related to manual labor, like in construction and manufacturing, have not grown as much.

How society, including employers, engages with all the people feeling underemployed or who've dropped out of the labor market is ""The chief human capital challenge for our generation going forward,"" Ferguson said.

Ferguson explained that our present skills gap can be bridged by adopting alternative educational models and workforce development programs and by employers training employees and new hires in the skills needed at their organizations.

""We still operate on an educational model that is based on Prussia in the Middle Ages,"" he said.

""A professor professes, the students take notes, they go home and do their homework, and then come back and take a test. Once you graduate from high school or college, you don't go back for more education.""

He pointed out that there has been a lot of market innovation in alternative education paths, including competency-based online degree programs that make people more employable for a much lower cost than traditional schooling.

""Technology is transforming the way that education is being delivered,"" he said.

The National Retail Federation is training people for retail jobs through online modules, for example, and the San Francisco Bay Area's Khan Academy has had tremendous success providing free, quality education that moves at the pace of each student.

""Students progress at their own pace, and do homework while in class,"" Ferguson said.

""The teacher presides as a facilitator or mentor.""

This model flips the classroom experience, said Sharlyn Lauby, SHRM-SCP, author, speaker and president of ITM Group Inc., a consulting firm in Weston, Fla., that focuses on developing training solutions.

""In traditional education, students learn the lesson in the classroom,"" she said.

""Homework is the activity that supports the lesson. The Khan Academy encourages students to listen to the lesson outside of the classroom, then do the activities in the classroom."" The Khan Academy model encourages people to practice and experiment with skills until they master them, she said.

It got her thinking: ""From a corporate learning perspective, where's the Khan Academy of business? Are organizations putting together books, videos, etc., so employees can become lifelong learners? Do employees have time on their schedule just to learn? If we want employees to succeed, they have to be able to learn anything.""

In Florida, the state workforce agency is asking local schools to include employability skills such as interviewing, communication, teamwork, time management, listening and networking in their curriculums.

""We want employees to be successful because when they are, the organization is successful,"" Lauby said.

""But that means organizations have to create a learning culture so they can spend time mastering the skills they need.""

Employers have not been as actively engaged as they should be with training workers on the changing skills needed in the 21st century workforce, Ferguson said.

""The idea of training on the job is a concept that was used to great success in the past, in areas such as manufacturing. Employers must take more responsibility to provide training to their workers, but at the same time, employees must view education and skills development as something that evolves, not solely as something that you do early in life.""

Ferguson recommended employers come up with ways to upskill their current workforce on capabilities needed at the organization and train candidates to help reduce talent deficits.

He's also a believer in the apprenticeship model.

""Apprenticeships do a terrific job helping young people learn employable skills and move into jobs at an early stage of their careers,"" he said.

""We need to figure out how to transfer that apprenticeship model to our service-based economy.""

2391,James Boyle,9/9/2017 10:00 AM,"Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-8, Middletown, joined a bipartisan group of federal legislators to introduce a bill designed to enhance training and education opportunities through apprenticeships.  According to a release from Fitzpatrick's office, the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act of 2017 will create a $5,000 tax credit based upon wages paid by companies that hire individuals enrolled in a federal or state registered apprenticeship program.

For employers participating in a multi-employer apprenticeship program, the credit rate would be $3 per hour each individual works. A worker must be employed for seven months before the credit can be claimed; it can be claimed as the apprentice works through the program for a maximum of three years. The bill also allows veterans to apply their previous skills and experience towards education hours so they can be put to use more quickly.  ""Apprenticeship programs grow our economy by fostering training programs that will prepare workers for in-demand careers,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""By closing the skills gap, this bipartisan program will encourage more good-paying jobs for working families, while addressing our nation?s current shortage of trained workers."""
